	<h2 class="d2 pr-4 pr-md-2 pr-sm-1 pr-xs-0">At SmartBear, I established a global design system in Sketch and Figma, creating consistent and scalable web experiences across 18+ marketing websites. I also certified and developed a robust web testing framework using Google Optimize, ensuring our interactive experiences met modern web standards. Additionally, I led the creation of a SaaS utility design system, which streamlined the product development cycle and significantly boosted team velocity.</h2>
