<section id="proj-intro">
	<h2 class="d2">At Sumo Logic, I spearheaded a major overhaul of our free trial system as part of a broader product design initiative, introducing dynamic nurture campaigns that significantly boosted user engagement and conversion rates. I also developed a comprehensive marketing design system using Figma, ensuring seamless collaboration across teams. Additionally, I leveraged Intellimize for web CRO testing, generating valuable insights that drove our digital growth initiatives and enhanced product adoption.</h2>
