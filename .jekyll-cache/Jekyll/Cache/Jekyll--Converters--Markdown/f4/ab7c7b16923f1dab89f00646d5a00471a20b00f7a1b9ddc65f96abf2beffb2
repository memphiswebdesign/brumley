	<h2 class="d2 pr-4 pr-md-2 pr-sm-1 pr-xs-0">During my tenure as Sr. UX Product Designer at BitBar {SmartBear}, I led the UI/Features team, crafting innovative web testing tools and front-end experiences. I established a global design system, streamlined user documentation, and conducted user testing and A/B testing for new web tools. Additionally, I conducted countless user sessions, managed stakeholder relationships, increase developer velocity, implemented UX guidelines for consistent SaaS experiences, and had some fun crafting a custom animation language &mdash; along the way.</h2>

					<h5 class="mb-0">Developer Adoption</h5>
					<p>At BitBar, the focus was on growing the user base and enhancing product adoption among technical users. I built a robust design system supporting new features and collaborated closely with users to ensure UX alignment with our product roadmap. Through dedicated user testing groups and A/B testing feature flag releases, we strategically enhanced the user experience.</p>
					<h5 class="mb-0">Strategic Feature Release</h5>
					<p>Strategic feature releases were pivotal in BitBarâ€™s rapid growth as a SaaS product. By integrating user feedback and leveraging UX principles, we ensured each release was finely tuned to meet user needs. The implementation of feature flagging allowed for controlled rollouts and iterative improvements, underscoring the critical role of UX in accelerating development cycles, boosting user satisfaction, and driving adoption.</p>
