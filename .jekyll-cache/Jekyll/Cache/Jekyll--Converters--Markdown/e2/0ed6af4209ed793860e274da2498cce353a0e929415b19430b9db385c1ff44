	<h2 class="d2 pr-0  pr-sm-0 pr-lg-2">During my tenure as Sr. UX Product Designer at BitBar, I led the UI/Features team, crafting innovative web testing tools and front-end experiences. I designed web marketing sites, streamlined user documentation, and conducted user testing and A/B testing for new web tools. Additionally, I shaped a robust design system library to increase developer velocity, implemented UX guidelines for consistent SaaS experiences, and created an animation library for user onboarding.</h2>
