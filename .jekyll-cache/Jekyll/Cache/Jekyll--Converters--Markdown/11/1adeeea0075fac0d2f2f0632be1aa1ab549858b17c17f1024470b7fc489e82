	<h2>During my tenure as Sr. UX Product Designer at BitBar, I crafted innovative web testing tools for Design, Dev, and QA teams. Leading the UI/Features team at CrossBrowserTesting, I utilized modern web languages and design tools within a scrum/sprint cycle to develop front-end experiences grounded in solid UI/UX principles. I designed and built web marketing sites, developed streamlined user documentation across platforms, and conducted user testing and A/B testing for new iterative web tooling. Additionally, I designed and implemented UX principle guidelines to ensure consistent SaaS platform experiences and created interactive web graphics and video content for user documentation and onboarding.</h2>
