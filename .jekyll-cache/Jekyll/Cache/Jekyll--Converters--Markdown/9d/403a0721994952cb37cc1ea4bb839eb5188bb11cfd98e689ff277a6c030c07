	<h2>During my tenure as Sr. UX Product Designer at BitBar, I crafted innovative web testing tools for Design, Dev, and QA teams. Leading the UI/Features team at CrossBrowserTesting, I developed front-end experiences grounded in solid UI/UX principles. I also designed and built web marketing sites, developed streamlined user documentation, and conducted user testing and A/B testing for new iterative web tooling. Additionally, I implemented UX guidelines for consistent SaaS platform experiences and created interactive web graphics and video content for user documentation and onboarding.</h2>
