<h2 id="creative-use-of-ai-in-analytics-and-personalization">Creative Use of AI in Analytics and Personalization</h2>

<h4 id="introduction-to-ai-in-analytics">Introduction to AI in Analytics</h4>

<p>The digital marketing landscape is rapidly evolving, and AI is at the forefront of this transformation. Gone are the days of relying solely on traditional analytics. Today, we’re talking about AI tools that do more than just crunch numbers; they provide insights that are akin to having a marketing guru whispering in your ear. Imagine AI systems that dig deep into social media sentiment, giving you a real-time pulse of your audience’s mood and preferences. This isn’t just about understanding the ‘what’ of user behavior, but the ‘why’ behind it.</p>

<h4 id="dynamic-content-personalization">Dynamic Content Personalization</h4>

<p>But AI’s magic doesn’t stop at analytics. It extends to how we personalize the web experience. Imagine visiting a website that adapts to your likes and dislikes, almost like it’s reading your mind. This is where AI-driven content personalization comes into play. Unlike basic A/B testing, AI can tweak website elements at a granular level, creating a unique experience for each user. For example, a fashion retailer might use AI to show different clothing items based on a user’s past browsing history, current trends, and even the weather in their location!</p>

<h4 id="real-world-example">Real-World Example</h4>

<p>Let’s take a real-world example. Spotify’s “Discover Weekly” feature is a perfect illustration of AI in action. It doesn’t just suggest songs you might like; it curates a playlist based on your unique taste, listening habits, and what similar users enjoy. This level of personalization keeps users engaged and coming back for more – a strategy any digital marketer would aspire to emulate in their campaigns.</p>

<h2 id="balancing-ai-automation-and-human-oversight">Balancing AI Automation and Human Oversight</h2>

<h4 id="the-synergy-between-ai-and-human-expertise">The Synergy Between AI and Human Expertise</h4>

<p>In the realm of AI and automation, there’s a delicate dance between letting technology lead and having human hands on the wheel. The goal isn’t to replace human expertise but to enhance it. AI can process and analyze data at an unimaginable scale, but it’s the human touch that interprets and applies these insights within the context of real-world scenarios. Think of AI as a high-powered engine in a car; it can go fast and efficiently, but you still need a driver to steer it in the right direction.</p>

<h4 id="role-of-it-teams-in-ai-governance">Role of IT Teams in AI Governance</h4>

<p>As AI becomes more integrated into our digital strategies, the role of IT teams evolves. They’re not just gatekeepers of data and systems; they’re now guardians of AI governance. This involves setting up frameworks to ensure AI operates within ethical guidelines and business objectives. For example, when deploying AI in customer service, while chatbots can handle routine queries, sensitive issues must be flagged for human intervention. This checks-and-balances system ensures that AI complements, rather than complicates, the customer experience.</p>

<h4 id="real-world-scenario-ai-in-e-commerce">Real-World Scenario: AI in E-Commerce</h4>

<p>Consider an e-commerce platform using AI for customer recommendations. While the AI can analyze purchase history and browsing behavior to suggest products, it’s the human team that ensures these recommendations align with current marketing strategies, stock availability, and cultural sensitivities. It’s this blend of AI efficiency and human insight that creates a seamless and effective customer journey.</p>

<div class="my-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="data-security-in-ai-driven-environments">Data Security in AI-Driven Environments</h2>

<h4 id="navigating-the-cybersecurity-landscape-with-ai">Navigating the Cybersecurity Landscape with AI</h4>

<p>In an AI-driven world, data security isn’t just a feature; it’s a foundational necessity. As AI systems gain access to more sensitive data, the potential risk of security breaches grows. It’s crucial to build AI solutions on a robust cybersecurity framework. This means not only safeguarding against external threats but also ensuring that the AI itself doesn’t become a vulnerability.</p>

<h4 id="ais-role-in-proactive-threat-detection">AI’s Role in Proactive Threat Detection</h4>

<p>AI can be a formidable ally in identifying and neutralizing threats before they become critical. For instance, AI algorithms can monitor network traffic patterns to detect anomalies that may indicate a security breach. However, the human element remains pivotal in interpreting these threats and deciding on the appropriate response. AI alerts, but humans assess and act.</p>

<hr />

<h6 id="case-study-financial-sectors-use-of-ai-in-security">Case Study: Financial Sector’s Use of AI in Security</h6>

<p>In the financial sector, where data sensitivity is paramount, AI is used to detect fraudulent activities. AI systems analyze transaction patterns and flag unusual activities for further investigation by human experts. This collaboration between AI and human insight creates a more secure and trustworthy environment for customers.</p>

<div class="my-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="ai-powered-personalization-and-web-testing">AI-Powered Personalization and Web Testing</h2>

<h4 id="revolutionizing-user-experience-with-ai">Revolutionizing User Experience with AI</h4>

<p>AI is transforming how we approach web testing and personalization. By leveraging AI, businesses can tailor their websites to individual users, creating highly personalized experiences. AI algorithms analyze user data like browsing history, device type, and interaction patterns to dynamically adjust website content.</p>

<h4 id="enhancing-testing-with-ai-driven-insights">Enhancing Testing with AI-Driven Insights</h4>

<p>In the field of web testing, AI can do more than just crunch numbers; it can predict user behavior and preferences. This capability enables businesses to create more effective A/B tests, leading to higher conversion rates. For example, an online retailer could use AI to determine the most effective layout and content for its product pages based on user interactions.</p>

<h4 id="real-world-example-media-streaming-services">Real-World Example: Media Streaming Services</h4>

<p>Consider how media streaming services use AI to personalize viewing experiences. They analyze viewing habits to recommend shows and movies, but it’s the creative teams who ensure these recommendations align with broader content strategies and cultural trends. This synergy between AI-driven data and human creativity enhances viewer engagement and satisfaction.</p>

<div class="my-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="ai-and-audience-segmentation-precision">AI and Audience Segmentation Precision</h2>

<h4 id="the-evolution-of-audience-segmentation">The Evolution of Audience Segmentation</h4>

<p>With AI, audience segmentation is becoming incredibly precise, shifting from broad demographics to nuanced, behavior-based groups. By analyzing data points like search queries, website interactions, and social media behavior, AI can segment audiences with unprecedented accuracy. This evolution enables marketers to craft highly targeted campaigns that resonate deeply with each segment.</p>

<h6 id="case-study-e-commerce-personalization">Case Study: E-commerce Personalization</h6>

<p>In e-commerce, AI-driven segmentation allows for personalized shopping experiences. For instance, an online fashion retailer can use AI to analyze past purchase history and browsing behavior, creating individualized product recommendations. This level of personalization not only enhances the user experience but also significantly boosts conversion rates.</p>

<h4 id="the-ethical-considerations-of-ai-segmentation">The Ethical Considerations of AI Segmentation</h4>

<p>While AI’s precision in audience segmentation is a powerful tool, it also raises ethical questions. There’s a fine line between personalization and privacy invasion. As we harness AI’s capabilities, it’s essential to maintain transparency with users about how their data is used and to give them control over their privacy settings.</p>

<div class="my-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="the-future-is-human-directed">The Future is Human-Directed</h2>

<h4 id="ai-as-a-tool-not-a-replacement">AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement</h4>

<p>The future of AI in marketing and design is not about replacing human creativity and decision-making but augmenting it. While AI can process and analyze data at an incredible speed, it lacks the human touch – the ability to understand context, emotions, and subtle nuances that define great design and marketing strategies.</p>

<h4 id="empowering-creativity-with-ai">Empowering Creativity with AI</h4>

<p>Imagine a scenario where a designer uses AI to generate multiple design prototypes based on certain parameters. The designer then applies their creative judgment to select and refine the best option. This combination of AI efficiency and human creativity leads to innovative designs that resonate with audiences on a deeper level.</p>

<h4 id="a-collaborative-future">A Collaborative Future</h4>

<p>The ideal future is one where AI tools and human professionals work in tandem, each playing to their strengths. AI provides speed and data-processing capabilities, while humans bring creativity, empathy, and ethical considerations. This collaboration ensures that the advancements in AI technology are harnessed responsibly and effectively for the benefit of all.</p>

<div class="my-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="the-next-frontier-openai-and-generative-ai">The Next Frontier: OpenAI and Generative AI</h2>

<h4 id="the-dawn-of-customizable-ai-platforms">The Dawn of Customizable AI Platforms</h4>

<p>The future of AI, particularly with initiatives like OpenAI, is heading towards customizable AI platforms. These platforms will allow developers and designers to create their own AI models tailored to specific business needs. This level of customization opens up new possibilities for innovation and efficiency.</p>

<h6 id="case-study-bespoke-ai-in-retail">Case Study: Bespoke AI in Retail</h6>

<p>Imagine a retail company building its AI model to predict upcoming fashion trends by analyzing social media data, current events, and historical sales data. This bespoke AI tool would give the retailer a competitive edge by staying ahead of trends and adjusting inventory accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="balancing-innovation-with-responsibility">Balancing Innovation with Responsibility</h4>

<p>As we move into this era of generative AI, the balance between innovation and responsibility becomes more critical. Companies will need to establish strong ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used in ways that are beneficial and non-detrimental to society. The focus should be on creating AI that enhances human capabilities, rather than replacing them.</p>

<h6 id="0000">00:00</h6>
<p>You’re listening to the Plaid Pixel podcast with your host, Eli Brumley and Ken Blasco. Let’s enter the world of web design, development and so much more. Hey guys, welcome back to the Plaid Pixel podcast.</p>

<h6 id="0020">00:20</h6>
<p>Our guest today is Swam with the startup Sharks. He has run multiple startup software companies as well as now traveling the world to help big brands through their marketing strategies and consulting.</p>

<h6 id="0030">00:30</h6>
<p>His name is Scooter Taylor. Mr. Taylor, how are you? What’s going on guys? How are y ‘all? I love that intro. Good man, good. We’re doing really good. We’re here with Ken. Good to have you on man. And Scooter, I know we’ve got a few topics we want to touch on.</p>

<h6 id="0045">00:45</h6>
<p>I know that your passion and pride is in digital marketing and as well as you’ve done several years of running the train of startups and startup culture. We’re so excited to dive into that in this episode.</p>

<h6 id="0101">01:01</h6>
<p>How about you start us off with who you are, your background, how you got into this industry? Yeah, no. Again, thanks for having me on. It’s exciting to always talk about a lot of the things that you’re working on and doing and you learn a lot through this.</p>

<h6 id="0119">01:19</h6>
<p>So this is really cool. And it’s fun to be working with you, man. I think for the listeners out there, I joined Eli’s dad’s Taekwondo school at nine years old and so became a white belt and just was in the program for several years to the point where I started teaching it and it was actually my first job.</p>

<h6 id="0138">01:38</h6>
<p>So I first job at like 13, 14 was teaching Taekwondo and I think when I started to teach there, I also started to learn the business, right? And I started to learn what happened before the kids started to show up, right?</p>

<h6 id="0151">01:51</h6>
<p>So the meetings, the planning, the thinking of marketing. The behind the scenes, yep. Yeah, no, exactly. So that was my first real. Yeah. Introduction into that and then you know seeing it all come to life right seeing us create a flyer Think of this like messaging and this marketing promotion and then you know by six o ‘clock Right parents and people are pulling out their wallets and paying for something that we just created and so That was the first step in the business and then of course, you know, I meet you being there and we were you know co -workers for several several years and Eli and I you know, we had this passion for just kind of just tinkering around on our laptops, right?</p>

<h6 id="0232">02:32</h6>
<p>You know, how do we use garage band? How do you use? I believe how do you create stuff? And the internet and especially consumer platforms for the internet were just starting to spring up Especially YouTube YouTube was just getting popular oh six or seven 2008 you know those three years specifically and So we we started you know, we started tinkering around I think that was some of the first introductions of the internet and potentially this whole start -up thing for sure.</p>

<h6 id="0304">03:04</h6>
<p>Yeah, we were definitely early stage, quote unquote, YouTubers getting into tips and tricks of technology. Back then, Apple was coming out with the iPhone, booming with their MacBook lineup. We focused more on the software side as well as just really new technology in general, stuff that was just so exciting about where the industry is moving to become from Palm Pilot to touchscreens.</p>

<h6 id="0333">03:33</h6>
<p>Now everything’s getting into a bigger form factor with mobile devices. And now we’re just seeing a mass takeover with how people are marketing these things instead of moving from desktop computing and having traditional desktop websites.</p>

<h6 id="0347">03:47</h6>
<p>Everything’s going into app format or social things and influence marketing. The vast variety of the world of marketing has changed since we started that. But I think it was so valuable for you and I to experience those early ages of how we see marketing today because it’s laid down a foundation of the appreciation for what it was.</p>

<h6 id="0413">04:13</h6>
<p>There’s a lot of golden nuggets that we picked up along the way to set the standard and the path that you and I are both on, even though that went down two different train tracks. It’s very much in this similar technology space and working and consulting and marketing.</p>

<h6 id="0431">04:31</h6>
<p>I want to jump to how you went to college and had some experiences with nonprofits but before you do that I want to tell a story which I don’t think even Ken has heard. It’s a story of when you and I were up one night making a lot of content and we were just chugging away just trying to get stuff out.</p>

<h6 id="0457">04:57</h6>
<p>really kind of focusing on our craft and trying to build better video editing skills and equipment and all this stuff. And you turned to me and you said, you know how everybody that works for Apple has a an Apple email address and a at apple .me.</p>

<h6 id="0515">05:15</h6>
<p>I was like, yeah. And he said, you know, we should go on iChat. So this is before Slack and all these other challenges. And he said, we should like type in, you know, rest in peace, Steve Jobs. This is before Steve was, you know, he was still kicking and we’ll type in like Steve at apple .me and wasmoz .apple .me and all these, you know, you know, Tim Cook and all these things.</p>

<h6 id="0540">05:40</h6>
<p>We just we’re just like plugging them in. And back then with iChat, if you typed in a valid like ad friend or ad user, if it was a valid email address and that person had an iChat account or an Apple account, it would show.</p>

<h6 id="0554">05:54</h6>
<p>that that person was valid. It would show their profile. So I don’t know if it was a security thing or not. It was kind of sketchy. But any Apple user could get on there. And you could see if that person was online or active, or when was the last time they were active.</p>

<h6 id="0607">06:07</h6>
<p>And so we’re tinkering on. Just had this crazy idea. And we put a few email addresses in to see if people were online or available to chat. And then we put in WIZ, W -O -Z, at Apple .me, in Donut Chat.</p>

<h6 id="0625">06:25</h6>
<p>And that avatar came up and it was him and his things said available. And we just started chatting with him. And he’s like, hey, guys, what’s going on? And it’s like, hey, we’re just some passionate guys from Memphis.</p>

<h6 id="0639">06:39</h6>
<p>And we wanted to just say, hey, we’re so we’re so happy that, you know, you were part of this journey and, you know, thank you for all the innovation you’ve brought to the world. And he’s like, oh, yeah, anytime.</p>

<h6 id="0652">06:52</h6>
<p>And he’s like, I’m on my I’m on my he’s like, I’m on my jet right now, headed over to do something. I think he was headed to a new Apple store opening or something. And Scooter’s like, let’s let’s let’s click the video call button and see if he picks up.</p>

<h6 id="0706">07:06</h6>
<p>See, this is really him, you know, because you never know who’s behind an avatar. Sure. And so he clicks the video icon. It rings for 10 or 15 seconds. And then Mr. Mr. WIZ pops up on the screen. And he’s on a private jet and he’s like, hey, guys, what’s going on?</p>

<h6 id="0723">07:23</h6>
<p>And we’re literally talking with Steve Wozniak. Over, you know, what was FaceTime? And we talked for maybe less than a minute. And then he sure he said farewell and good luck. And then we went our separate ways.</p>

<h6 id="0739">07:39</h6>
<p>I thought that was the craziest experience that I’ve ever had, you know, with celebrities, I guess. If that doesn’t inspire you, I don’t know what would, right? That’s crazy. There’s some small town kids that will tinker with technology in Memphis and had this crazy.</p>

<h6 id="0754">07:54</h6>
<p>idea and the guy was friendly enough to open up his webcam and talk to us for a few minutes. I thought it said a lot about his character and Yeah, it also talks about you know where scooter and I have we’ve come from because You know you had you had to buy your your Mac and then you know obviously your OS was pre -installed but then you had to install I work which had your text editor and PowerPoint, you know, and so they’ve kind of included all that now but Long long story short.</p>

<h6 id="0827">08:27</h6>
<p>I’ve known scooter for a while. He’s he’s a fantastic guy super inspiring to be around just has really great energy and and Scooter I know that you you know you dough from from high school directly into college and then with your passion for for charities and nonprofits You wanted to just take on one yourself you want to tell us a little bit about how you got into that space Yeah, no, I mean I think you know in the spirit of what you just talked about.</p>

<h6 id="0854">08:54</h6>
<p>We didn’t really know what we were doing, we were just doing a lot of it, right? We didn’t really, yeah we didn’t have a name. I think now if you’re you know 14, 15 you kind of know like I want to be a digital marketer or you know you kind of have a name for it but we didn’t really have a name for it and so going into college I was still you know 2011 and I’m like okay what I want to do right?</p>

<h6 id="0916">09:16</h6>
<p>What I want to be? I think I signed up for international marketing so I knew it was marketing, I knew I wanted to kind of travel around the world and do stuff but I didn’t know what exactly and let the whole first year go by and at the end of that first year someone reached out to me and said you know hey you should see this YouTube video of the world’s largest water balloon fight.</p>

<h6 id="0937">09:37</h6>
<p>12 ,000 college students, well at the time the YouTube video was actually like 7 ,000 kids throwing like you know a hundred thousand water balloons and so they all get together they donate some money and then they fill up a football field full of water balloons and they just have this massive full -out war.</p>

<h6 id="0957">09:57</h6>
<p>Yeah so I mean there wasn’t even a charity thing there’s was just like hey like let’s just throw some water balloon fight and so you know I think some of it was just kind of like confidence I was like oh I just came from this YouTube era where I knew how to you know get subscribers and get people to sign up for things, build websites, do content, graphic design, social media and you know even in the YouTube things, YouTube days we did a lot of things around social impact as well and charity so I was like hey I think I understand how to do this what if we did a water balloon fight and then one of my buddies was like okay well you can’t just waste all this water there’s actually people that need water and I didn’t really know what he was talking about until I looked up and we learned about the water crisis and I learned that there are close to a billion people that don’t have access to clean water every day and I think we know about it more now because it’s kind of hit domestically with Flint, Michigan.</p>

<h6 id="1054">10:54</h6>
<p>We’ve all heard about Flint. But before in 2011, it was very international, Sub -Saharan Africa. So what we did was we said, hey, we’re going to create a nonprofit. We’re going to bring 12 ,000 college students together.</p>

<h6 id="1106">11:06</h6>
<p>They’re going to throw 300 ,000 water balloons. And if all 12 ,000 people donate five bucks, we can raise 60 grand to go build wells in Sub -Saharan Africa. And so we set out on this mission. And again, just really using the skills that I had just learned a couple years before with UI of going, okay, I know how to reach out to brands.</p>

<h6 id="1126">11:26</h6>
<p>So the first thing I did, I said, okay, let me reach out to the current record holders. And so I sent them an email. They responded, hopped on the phone. And then I asked them, I said, hey, where’d you get your water balloons?</p>

<h6 id="1136">11:36</h6>
<p>And they said, we got them from this company. So then I found out Lady’s email address and I emailed her. And I just, you know, and so just kind of kept like You know softly doing business development like back then I wouldn’t have called it business development But that’s basically what it was.</p>

<h6 id="1149">11:49</h6>
<p>Yeah, just going in and just kind of telling people what you want to do and You know long story short we didn’t end up doing the water balloon fight And so you know cried for probably three days after that got a lot of momentum But just like logistically, you know trying to bring 12 ,000 college students and you know We didn’t think through that level of detail again.</p>

<h6 id="1212">12:12</h6>
<p>I’m only 19 years old And so just some things just you don’t know what you don’t know But we we have helped 3 ,000 people get access to clean water Which was phenomenal and I think you know there’s a good lesson of going you know Hey, like just because you know what you think you want it didn’t work out like you know Just keep keep searching for for the real impact but yeah, that was that was a That was sophomore year college up until probably you know the fourth year So probably second third year college really doing that I want to say hats off to you for for not waiting around for a a big brand or You know a university to try to make a global impact.</p>

<h6 id="1253">12:53</h6>
<p>It was it was literally a guy from Memphis traveled to Atlanta and had just ideas and ambition to to do something with that and obviously You know knowing you for a long time You’re a fun loving guy as long as you’re having fun you’re you’re living and if you can do that with college kids and raise money I mean you you’ve got the you’ve got the golden key to do to a massive social campaign and hats off to you for you know, just having the the confidence and courage to step out of You know most college students or even grown adults now don’t have the confidence to even approach something like that They rely on big brands and corporations to try to quote -unquote, you know Help people around the world and have these global change and obviously it’s you know, it’s a big PR thing, but yeah You know you were that wasn’t your interest that wasn’t what?</p>

<h6 id="1344">13:44</h6>
<p>you’re doing it for you, you’re doing out your heart and want to do something fun for the college kids. And so I think that just speaks to who you are, man. And it’s taken you as a character down this huge path of getting you into the startup space.</p>

<h6 id="1359">13:59</h6>
<p>But no, I mean, I think, you know, for, like you said, we just didn’t know what we’re doing. I didn’t set out going like, Oh, I want to make a million dollars. I think there was one thing that was interesting.</p>

<h6 id="1411">14:11</h6>
<p>I applied for a Google internship, and I thought I was going to get it because I was like, Oh, my YouTube partner, like we made YouTube videos and Google YouTube. So I’m definitely going to get this.</p>

<h6 id="1420">14:20</h6>
<p>And I got rejected. And I remember that feeling that that sucks. So I do remember going like, Okay, this is going to, this is going to be my internship, you know, like I won’t have to go through this again.</p>

<h6 id="1432">14:32</h6>
<p>Right? I’m going to like create something that’s, you know, it’s going to be undeniable that you want me next. So I remember that being a thing. But yeah, I mean, you know, I think you to your point, always having fun, right?</p>

<h6 id="1447">14:47</h6>
<p>Was also something that’s always stuck with me. And so I think it’s a nature of, you know, just job history and experiences. I think, you know, people are a collection of their experiences, right? And so my first job was, you know, kicking around with my bare feet and like, you know, makeshift pajamas out of a taekwondo mat.</p>

<h6 id="1509">15:09</h6>
<p>You know, that was my first job instead of being like, you know, behind a deep fryer at a Chick -fil -A or something. And so what I learned from the water project was that we got really close, right?</p>

<h6 id="1519">15:19</h6>
<p>Like I was, you know, having conversations with Pepsi’s, you know, digital marketing team and their like sponsorships team. And, you know, we were on the radio in Atlanta and there were kids across the country who were, you know, hitting me up about this.</p>

<h6 id="1533">15:33</h6>
<p>And so, and just like YouTube, right? We had 20 ,000 subscribers on YouTube. We were getting paid on YouTube. We had, you know, we were shipping products to Germany for people who were, you know, doing stuff with us.</p>

<h6 id="1543">15:43</h6>
<p>So it was one of those things where I could taste like, you know, this like magnitude of success and it just built confidence that like, oh, I can do this. So all that to say, all that to say, I actually went to a conference.</p>

<h6 id="1556">15:56</h6>
<p>I had a teacher send me on to a conference and on the plane ride back, I remember I had all these business cards and I was like, okay, you know, done the water thing twice. We’ve kind of failed and I need to like really find an internship and find a job because that’s what everyone else is like stressing about on college right now.</p>

<h6 id="1615">16:15</h6>
<p>So I had all these business cards from this conference and I was like, okay, I’m gonna just email all these people and, you know, go find a job. And I sit next to this guy and he starts talking about Qualcomm, which is a technology company out of San Diego.</p>

<h6 id="1628">16:28</h6>
<p>I knew about Qualcomm because we had talked about Qualcomm on our technology YouTube. And I think we’ve got a huge player in the West Coast that also, they do software advancements as well as, don’t they have like, they have some hardware aspect to their company.</p>

<h6 id="1644">16:44</h6>
<p>as well. Yeah, I’ll break it down. So, you know, you’re able to make phone calls, really 3G, all that stuff was really created because of Qualcomm. They had the patent on the chips to really facilitate that type of interaction.</p>

<h6 id="1658">16:58</h6>
<p>And so I’m sitting next to this guy, we’re talking about Qualcomm, I start talking about technology, and then I start talking about my experiences. I start talking about Taekwondo a little bit, I talk about YouTube, and I talk about technology, and I talk about, you know, the water project we had just, you know, attempted.</p>

<h6 id="1714">17:14</h6>
<p>And by the end of the plane ride, he’s like, you deserve an internship. And so I was like, okay, I was like, okay, thanks. Let’s keep in touch. And so I followed up, I kept in touch, and lo and behold, my first internship was in San Diego.</p>

<h6 id="1729">17:29</h6>
<p>Fast forward. sitting at a bar in San Diego and someone goes, have you heard of this app called Yikyak? And I was like, no, I haven’t heard of it. And they’re like, man, it’s a new app, it’s out of Atlanta, it’s blowing up, you said you’re from Atlanta, you should definitely check it out.</p>

<h6 id="1743">17:43</h6>
<p>I had never heard of it, so I was like, hey, it must not be that popping. So I get back to Atlanta and I see these guys who started Yikyak and they are at a hackathon and they’re talking about their app and how they did it.</p>

<h6 id="1757">17:57</h6>
<p>And so I’m listening to them talk and I’m like, yo, this is very similar to my YouTube days and the water days, right? You’re just sitting there, you’re hustling, you’re grinding, you’re doing stuff that doesn’t feel good, but it’s fun and you’re starting to see some success.</p>

<h6 id="1812">18:12</h6>
<p>And so their story kind of resonated with me and I was like, yes, they’re talking my language. And then I saw them again and I was like, hey guys, I just did this water balloon fight thing and I failed miserably, but you guys have so many color students on your app that if you guys did this water balloon fight, it would make so much sense.</p>

<h6 id="1832">18:32</h6>
<p>And you have like $85 million in funding from investors. I just needed $14 ,000 to put this whole thing together and I could barely get a thousand. So you guys have 85 million, you’re bound to do it, you should try it.</p>

<h6 id="1846">18:46</h6>
<p>And so the guy gives me the- You got everything you need to succeed. Yeah, I’m like, you can do this 85 million times, you want to do it. And so he gives me his email and yeah, gets his email and I didn’t follow up, but then I ended up following up later and I was like, hey, I really would like an internship.</p>

<h6 id="1910">19:10</h6>
<p>So this is a year after I did the whole plane ride internship. That was one year, this is the next year now. And I’m like, hey, I love an internship. And they’re like, hey, we actually have never hired an intern before, but come on in.</p>

<h6 id="1923">19:23</h6>
<p>And at that moment, I joined the team, I was probably the 10th person on the team, first intern ever. And I was at my first venture back then. fact, quote unquote startup that you would read on TechCrunch.</p>

<h6 id="1935">19:35</h6>
<p>That’s awesome. Wow. Yeah. So it was, it was a whirlwind. I mean, but it felt, it felt right. I mean, it felt right. Um, and like it was cool, right? I was going into the office and it was really cool because it was in Atlanta.</p>

<h6 id="1950">19:50</h6>
<p>Um, and so it was one of those things where like when we were in that office, it was just like us against the world, right? It was like, I’m working on Yik Yak, right? And I get to see the behind the scenes and I get to, and again, it was, it was, I remember texting my mom saying like, this is a culmination of like almost everything I’ve ever done, right?</p>

<h6 id="2009">20:09</h6>
<p>Just kind of seeing this, like how this operates. Um, and it was cool because I had the, I had the big company experience from Qualcomm, which is like, you know, massive thousands of employee experience where, you know, Yik Yak, they didn’t even have an intern program.</p>

<h6 id="2023">20:23</h6>
<p>They didn’t even know what to. how to really onboard me for to be an intern. And I was like, yo, you guys, this is trash. Like, and so the first meeting, you know, my manager is like, what do you want to do first?</p>

<h6 id="2034">20:34</h6>
<p>And luckily I had the experience. And luckily I had the experience where I was like, hey, I want to actually meet the whole team. And because I knew that I knew from my Qualcomm days, like, okay, who am I reporting to?</p>

<h6 id="2045">20:45</h6>
<p>But then who was that person reporting to? And how does this all work together? Right? I know about startups and know about the app, but like, who’s the lead developer? Who’s the product designer? Who does the bugs?</p>

<h6 id="2055">20:55</h6>
<p>Who, you know, and so we did that. It was only like, you know, 10 people, but I remember them being very impressed and them being like, who is this intern kid who just, you know, requested 25 minutes on my calendar?</p>

<h6 id="2107">21:07</h6>
<p>Why am I talking to you? But it really, it really made two things happen. I think A, it let them know that I was serious about really making an impact in the company, but then B, it helped me understand just the lay of the land and just understand like, when I have a creative marketing idea, how does that actually impact the whole company, right?</p>

<h6 id="2130">21:30</h6>
<p>And is that gonna inform a new product feature? Is that gonna require this? Is that gonna, you know, switch the messaging up where the PR team is trying to do? So that was a really cool moment to be inside that startup.</p>

<h6 id="2142">21:42</h6>
<p>That’s crazy. I think I think I touched on this last podcast and this comes full circle with being kind of, you know, both Apple fanboys from back in the day is, you know, Steve Jobs, Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish, and just having not even considering that no is an answer, not even considering that there is a gray, it’s just, it’s all forward motion and putting it out there that you’re gonna do something and having the level of energy that you present, kind of putting that out in the universe.</p>

<h6 id="2215">22:15</h6>
<p>I think just in general speaks to your success and how we in general just approach, you know, those that are moving forward to technology, how we’re moving forward. we approach and we see how we see things moving.</p>

<h6 id="2228">22:28</h6>
<p>And whether you want to call it visionary or just kind of ahead of the curve, it’s just asking questions and staying hungry, staying foolish, I think is just so powerful to remember those words and know that even though you’re just a guy, you’re just an intern and you’re calling in to talk to the lead engineers, the lead developers on these projects, it just speaks to your character.</p>

<h6 id="2253">22:53</h6>
<p>And I really respect that about you because you don’t approach, scooter, you don’t approach conversations and conflict with, oh, there could be a no. You’ve never done that. You’ve always say, this is the relationship I want to build.</p>

<h6 id="2309">23:09</h6>
<p>And so I just ask for it. And nine times out of 10, they say, oh, sure, this guy sounds like pretty legit. He sounds like a friendly guy. And it just works. It’s a beautiful thing. Yeah, no, yeah, no, it’s been cool.</p>

<h6 id="2323">23:23</h6>
<p>I mean, I think, you know. I think it’s always easier when you’re stepping back and like trying to assess it and like call it what it is. But like in the moment, you know, you’re just really moving. And to your point, you just kind of know what you wanna do and you just kind of go keep asking for it and try to add value as much as possible, right?</p>

<h6 id="2342">23:42</h6>
<p>I think that that’s the key point there is like understanding that, hey, like I’m just as valuable at the table as the CTO, as the CEO, you know, I’m here, like I’m in the room, I’m on the payroll, I’m here.</p>

<h6 id="2357">23:57</h6>
<p>I have an email access, right? And so if I didn’t want me here, then I probably wouldn’t be here. So the fact that I’m now here, how do I like add value in the way that I can best, right? And, you know, like be okay and confident in that.</p>

<h6 id="2413">24:13</h6>
<p>I think when you, you know, it’s in it, I can say confidently too, that probably when I was at Yicac, my confidence was even higher than it probably had been, has been in the last like six months, right?</p>

<h6 id="2425">24:25</h6>
<p>Transitioning to 2020 after you actually have a startup and you’re like even more on the front lines, right? But now, you know, coming out of that, you just kind of like shake it off and you rebuild.</p>

<h6 id="2434">24:34</h6>
<p>And so there’s ebbs and flows, but you know, that’s a big, big fundamental key. So Yicac was a really cool app, not to get too ingrained with the history and the functionality of it, but basically it’s kind of an open forum app where people can add feedback and vote up and down on stats and, you know, we’ll leave links below.</p>

<h6 id="2454">24:54</h6>
<p>Some articles about. Think Reddit, Reddit but anonymous. It was definitely, it was basically Reddit for this anonymous with no users. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good or bad. So you, after several, probably over a year or two, they hired several dozen employees and then eventually they folded.</p>

<h6 id="2512">25:12</h6>
<p>And then you moved on to your next venture, Stepping Stone, which was in 2016. You wanna talk about that? Yeah, man. So, you know, at Yikak, I thought like, oh man, I’m about to get hired, right? Like I started when there was only barely 20 people here.</p>

<h6 id="2533">25:33</h6>
<p>You guys now have like almost 100. I’m definitely gonna get hired, right? I’m gonna be the product marketing associate. I can’t wait. And so that didn’t happen. They said, okay, we actually don’t have space for you.</p>

<h6 id="2547">25:47</h6>
<p>We kind of have space for you. It’s on a contract basis. So like, you know, we’ll pay you like, it was something like crazy amount, like 40 bucks an hour, like something crazy like that. And it’s like, we’ll pay you like 40, 50 bucks an hour.</p>

<h6 id="2601">26:01</h6>
<p>And, but it’s only for three months. And so in my mind, I was like, oh, I’m just gonna, you know, do this until, you know, I go out to San Francisco and find a real job, you know? And then I got a call from a, you know, colleague, mentor, big brother, how do you want to call it?</p>

<h6 id="2618">26:18</h6>
<p>Who had seen my work with Water Wars and was like, hey, there’s a startup. They’re starting in Atlanta. They’re about to go to San Francisco and go through this accelerator called Y Commator and they they need someone to really fill the marketing lane.</p>

<h6 id="2635">26:35</h6>
<p>I think you can do it. And so on that phone call I said okay look man I just signed this deal with Yik Yak so I don’t want to let them down. I don’t want to go to work and quit tomorrow. Can I join you in a month?</p>

<h6 id="2648">26:48</h6>
<p>And he said no. He said you got to make a decision like now. And so I said okay look if you can get it in writing I will join. Until then you know it’s kind of a soft no but if you get in writing I’m in.</p>

<h6 id="2701">27:01</h6>
<p>So took them a week and a half to get it in writing. I think I collected a paycheck or two from Yik Yak and next thing you know I’m on a plane to San Francisco. You know about to go through Y Commator which which for me like I had again you know I was at Yik Yak right I was studying startups.</p>

<h6 id="2719">27:19</h6>
<p>I knew I wanted to start a company and do startups right. I mean I had done YouTube and I had done this water project and I tasted what that success could look like and so I thought Yik Yak was like oh this is successful right.</p>

<h6 id="2731">27:31</h6>
<p>$85 million in funding tens of thousands of users this is what success is. And then I also knew that like you know if you want to start a company then you probably would want to go through like a really nice accelerator like Y Commator.</p>

<h6 id="2745">27:45</h6>
<p>And so when I wasn’t going to be able to really work at Yik Yak the way I probably wanted to I saw Y Commator as like the next best like not even next best but even better opportunity. It was like oh this is actually like better you know you’re actually getting closer to what you want to do right.</p>

<h6 id="2801">28:01</h6>
<p>You actually don’t. So Y Commator is based out of San Francisco and they’re kind of an incubation for startups. Yeah so you spend three months in San Francisco. You know Y Commator is actually really good.</p>

<h6 id="2813">28:13</h6>
<p>It’s like you know kind of the Harvard of accelerators. Some people would call it but you know they were the first investors in Airbnb and Dropbox. box as well. And so when you think about, so basically what happens is they accept, you know, 100 companies every batch and they say, okay, we’re going to give you 100 grand.</p>

<h6 id="2834">28:34</h6>
<p>We’re going to invest in your company. Here’s 100, 100 grand. We’re going to take, you know, a small percentage of your company, but then you’re also going to like work with us for the next three months and we have some of the best mentors.</p>

<h6 id="2844">28:44</h6>
<p>We’re going to bring in speakers. You have a massive network of other people who went through Y Comvator. So if you have a business that you’re trying to pitch to Airbnb, yo, here are the founders’ emails.</p>

<h6 id="2854">28:54</h6>
<p>Go talk to them, right? They’re open to talking to, you know, other Y Comvator founders. And so it’s this, you know, network support system and just like incubator or accelerator, sorry, that says, you know, hey, we want to accelerate the growth.</p>

<h6 id="2908">29:08</h6>
<p>We think we have a good idea. We think you have a good something. With these resources, this capital, this network, we can go take this from, you know, you’re maybe doing barely $10 ,000 a month to doing, you know, half million a year, right?</p>

<h6 id="2923">29:23</h6>
<p>And revenue. Let’s go do that. Sure. So we are going to provide resources, connections, and just kind of the fuel to the fire to get this thing rolling down the tracks. And then you kind of take it from there.</p>

<h6 id="2936">29:36</h6>
<p>For sure, for sure. And I’ll make sure we add this at the end in the show notes. But they’ve got a lot of information online about the advice they offer and the resources. And it’s amazing going through the program, for sure.</p>

<h6 id="2952">29:52</h6>
<p>Awesome. So if anybody is looking to enter the startup space, that’s definitely kind of a go -to resource, you’d say? Yeah, for sure, right? I mean, I think there’s a lot of ways to launch a company.</p>

<h6 id="3004">30:04</h6>
<p>And so a couple of the models you see are accelerators. And then you also have incubators, right? And so an accelerator is more like, again, accelerating growth. They’re usually three, maybe four months.</p>

<h6 id="3016">30:16</h6>
<p>You get some cash in exchange for equity in your company. And you get access to resources, mentors, and they help you as you and your team scale the company, right? This is probably in the super early days.</p>

<h6 id="3030">30:30</h6>
<p>You probably have a product. You maybe have a customer, probably not. And you’re just trying to figure out what works still. And then there’s also incubators would say, OK, hey, this incubator is a little bit longer.</p>

<h6 id="3044">30:44</h6>
<p>We’re going to actually, you don’t really need a team. Like we have a team of designers and developers. We’re going to help you build this company with you together. You’re probably going to give up a little bit more equity in the company.</p>

<h6 id="3055">30:55</h6>
<p>It’s going to be a little bit less of a more of a partnership. You’re more tied to them. Whereas the accelerator, you kind of leave after you’re done. And you go back into the world. But yeah. Awesome.</p>

<h6 id="3107">31:07</h6>
<p>Thanks for describing the difference to those. I think that brings a lot of clarity to how people should think through their startup and which path they should take. So on this startup train, something that I’m so interested in is the whole culture around startup because typically just if you’re a technologist or hobbyist, you think of startup, you might have a negative or positive inkling or feeling kind of about how you deem startups.</p>

<h6 id="3136">31:36</h6>
<p>I would love to because you’ve just been so involved with them and you’ve done two or three startups at this point, what is the culture of startups in 2019 and 2020? If you maybe dive into some tips and tricks and some of the things to kind of look out for when getting a startup and then for those looking to maybe they have an idea that they’re just itching to boost and get out there, how do you get started with all this?</p>

<h6 id="3202">32:02</h6>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean startups are is the buzzword of like probably the decade, like the last two this decade coming up in the last one. I think one of the misconceptions and I think you just had to learn this is really like company building is what you’re doing right here building a company at the end of the day you’re building you’re you’re putting out a product.</p>

<h6 id="3226">32:26</h6>
<p>Service you’re trying to go sell it for money you’re trying to go make you know some kind of margin on it you know make some money on it and it’s gonna be a company and so i think. You know movies and the mark zuckerbergs of the world and media have kind of like fantasize this like startup culture where it’s like oh yeah we have a startup which is very true right starting it up.</p>

<h6 id="3248">32:48</h6>
<p>But those days are ugly those days are really ugly and like they’re not as glorious and as it as it seems right until you know it becomes a full fledged company with enough revenue that. You know the company stays you know in business for years and you have a runway and like you know the goal is to really you know create you know this like enterprise value and like.</p>

<h6 id="3312">33:12</h6>
<p>Meaningful company meaning from revenue meaningful customers a meaningful product like that’s what you’re doing right that’s the that’s the you know thirty year forty year vision. Now on day one yes it is a startup and we’ve got to be scrappy and we can wear pajamas and we can you know you know work out of our buddies garage yes.</p>

<h6 id="3331">33:31</h6>
<p>And so i think that’s like the first like just a mindset shift right around what are we actually doing because what you know what i like to say is like. You know these things can take a long time but then it can also happen very quickly where okay great we have an idea it’s kind of working and then oh wait you know like.</p>

<h6 id="3349">33:49</h6>
<p>You know i imagine how many people right now right who had this like idea around virtual hangouts or virtual this or virtual that it was probably never really working no one was using it. And then all of last week everyone is now trapped in their homes quarantine from coronavirus and everyone’s like i need something virtual to host my clients or my this or my conference or my conference my gosh.</p>

<h6 id="3416">34:16</h6>
<p>And now you’re you know and now you’re you’re. your product is like you have a wait list of customers, right? And this just changed overnight. And so I think it’s important to just have that mindset that, like, yes, we’re having fun.</p>

<h6 id="3433">34:33</h6>
<p>Yes, it’s maybe a little bit more relaxed than a corporate job, quote unquote. But in the end, I’m here to go create economic value for myself, hopefully for my employees and my team. If you plan on taking investors, you then have a legit fiduciary responsibility to create value for them.</p>

<h6 id="3455">34:55</h6>
<p>And it’s like by law, right? So I mean, it’s just a thing to think about. And not saying it takes the phone out of it, but that’s something to think about. Yeah. Yeah, I was saying something about startups that I think are so fascinating is it all comes down to market value.</p>

<h6 id="3512">35:12</h6>
<p>And a lot of the startups that are out there right now and have been in the past decade, a lot of those guys are… So far ahead of the curve, as far as the audience, that it’s a brilliant idea. And it all comes down to timing, right?</p>

<h6 id="3526">35:26</h6>
<p>Timing is everything. So they could literally have one of the best ideas. And you think of someone that might have come up with a virtual conference 10 or 15 years ago, people looked at him like, man, that’s a weirdest idea.</p>

<h6 id="3536">35:36</h6>
<p>Like no one’s going to buy that. If you were to carry that concept through and continue to refine it and build an audience, I mean, here we are going through this craziness of COVID -19. And everybody can’t get enough of virtual software and trying to figure out how to stay at home to spread this disease.</p>

<h6 id="3552">35:52</h6>
<p>Or toilet paper. Yeah, whatever it is, you can, yeah. Exactly. To get you through the week. So I think people have so many great ideas, so many great app ideas, and something to keep in mind whenever you’re looking to do a startup is to think, is the world ready for it?</p>

<h6 id="3613">36:13</h6>
<p>And if you go back and look at, is it an inspirational film, the social network, back in 2010, those guys literally did it out of the dorm room. They were hustling, just trying to figure out several ideas that failed or got shut down.</p>

<h6 id="3631">36:31</h6>
<p>And eventually, he figured out a solution. He figured out what worked. And if that was an exclusive network of people, and then it got caught on to college students the time because all college students were getting laptops.</p>

<h6 id="3645">36:45</h6>
<p>And again, that’s the son of the times with timings everything, with people getting laptops instead of having to go to the library to check on, get on the internet. And so there was this huge wave of everybody getting laptops and to have something that connects everybody on a college campus, it would have been a crazy idea if he would have done it eight years before.</p>

<h6 id="3706">37:06</h6>
<p>And now it’s a multi trillion dollar company. And so it’s fascinating to me that it’s not necessarily about the idea or the network. It’s kind of all of these stars have to align for a lot of these stars.</p>

<h6 id="3719">37:19</h6>
<p>startups to be these massive companies. Yeah, I know. I mean, you’re hitting around the money. Added investor, one of my first investors in the last venture would always say, we just kind of got to be out in the ocean, right?</p>

<h6 id="3732">37:32</h6>
<p>And catch the wave. It’s like, you want to go surf. Well, we can’t surf if you’re sitting on the beach and you’re scared to go out there. So that’s number one. So we got to go out there. We got to build.</p>

<h6 id="3744">37:44</h6>
<p>We got to go put a product out to the market. We got to go test it. But then also, let’s not be rigid. Let’s be fluid enough to stay out there. And so we know we’re going to wipe out, but we got to paddle back out there.</p>

<h6 id="3756">37:56</h6>
<p>Sometimes we might just be sitting out there waiting. But then, boom, to your point, a market thing changes. Apple comes out with a new feature that allows something different. Or boom, there’s a national pandemic that changes the way the society has to live.</p>

<h6 id="3810">38:10</h6>
<p>Or. boom, there’s like an event that happens that changes the landscape of this, right? Or you just never really know, but like we need to be out in the ocean, right? Because the ones that are out in the ocean actually catch the wave.</p>

<h6 id="3820">38:20</h6>
<p>And so for two- You can ride the waves and then throw in the sharks. You know, it’s yeah, and if we’re just too scared to like, to be out there, then we’re never gonna hit it. You know, we’re never gonna hit it.</p>

<h6 id="3831">38:31</h6>
<p>That’s a beautiful analogy for exactly what, you know, what startups have to go through because it’s a rocky terrain. Yeah, no, it’s, it’s, it’s, it sucks, right? It’s easier said than done. It sucks to pivot your company, right?</p>

<h6 id="3844">38:44</h6>
<p>I imagine there are many startups right now that are probably unfortunately laying off their, you know, their team right now, you know, I mean, these things are not fun, but they are, you know, part of being out there in the ocean.</p>

<h6 id="3858">38:58</h6>
<p>And you have to, you know, be ready and ready to, to like face those moments. And it’s not saying that it’s always you that has to do that, right? That’s why you have a team and you maybe have someone that helps you do these things, but you know, it’s not all peaches and lollipops and rainbows.</p>

<h6 id="3917">39:17</h6>
<p>There are a good moment, but yeah, I love pecans, but, but it is, you know, it is rewarding for sure. Awesome. So can you give us maybe some just quick bulleted items? And I know we’re gonna have show notes and stuff that will elaborate a lot of these as well as resource and links that people can dive into to gather more insight and knowledge into this subject.</p>

<h6 id="3938">39:38</h6>
<p>But can you give us a little bit of bulleted links on kind of how, how to get started? What are some things that we need to know to get started in the startup space and what are the first steps, you know, kind of what, I know we have ideas, right?</p>

<h6 id="3949">39:49</h6>
<p>So you gotta have an idea. Yeah. So, you know, having an idea is definitely, is definitely one thing, right? It’s, and so, you know, again, a lot of it is, is testing and iterating fast. So when you think about startups, it’s, you know, how do we go fast, right?</p>

<h6 id="4006">40:06</h6>
<p>And not every company needs to move us fast as a technology startup. So I’m really going off of my experience with technology startups. But not everything has to move as fast as a technology startup, but you want to move faster.</p>

<h6 id="4022">40:22</h6>
<p>You don’t want to spend time on something that’s just not going to work because these things are hard. There’s a lot of energy, there’s a lot of time, there’s a lot of resources, a lot of money, a lot of late nights.</p>

<h6 id="4032">40:32</h6>
<p>And so if we’re working on something that’s not about to be a big thing, then why are we working on it that hard? Let’s just go. Let’s keep thinking through ideas. But to your point, first is the idea.</p>

<h6 id="4043">40:43</h6>
<p>I think finding the customer, who is the person that’s going to use or user or the product? What’s the product and who would use it? And then let’s go test and see if that’s actually true. Right? And so, you know…</p>

<h6 id="4102">41:02</h6>
<p>There’s a lot of resources out there that probably will tell you to do it in a lean startup way with building an MVP. And again, that’s just iterating. So it’s not saying, hey, let’s go to Garage and let’s go build the perfect website and the perfect app, and then give it to our customer.</p>

<h6 id="4118">41:18</h6>
<p>It’s saying, hey, let’s go build the bare bones minimum for them to actually use it. Okay, cool. That’s three screens, a couple buttons, and just enough to get some type of behind it to do some market research.</p>

<h6 id="4129">41:29</h6>
<p>Yeah, for them to say like, cool, I’m in. And then from there, you know, let’s keep building on that. I think another way, even zooming out of the weeds a little bit, I think people should, you know, convince themselves first that they can do this.</p>

<h6 id="4145">41:45</h6>
<p>And then after they convince themselves, go convince a team to kind of go probably be around them and help them do this. Then after that, you kind of go convince your users to either use your product or give you money for the product.</p>

<h6 id="4200">42:00</h6>
<p>And then you go try to convince investors that they should invest in you. So yourself, your team, your users, you know, you can probably flip those maybe, you know, your users and your team, but then investors like last, I think so many people are trying to convince, you know, investors before they’ve even really convinced themselves that they are in this for the long haul to go start a company.</p>

<h6 id="4223">42:23</h6>
<p>Or you find people who just have that order flipped where, you know, they’re trying to go convince, mainly as investors, but, you know, again, like convince yourself and say, okay, hey, like, I believe like this should happen.</p>

<h6 id="4236">42:36</h6>
<p>This should work. Okay, I don’t know how to go build the company, or maybe I know how to go build it. I don’t know how to go market it. Let me go convince someone to come on my team and be my salesperson or be my business development lead or go be my CTO.</p>

<h6 id="4248">42:48</h6>
<p>Okay, cool. Now that I got my squad, let’s go build the product. And then once you go build the product, let’s go put it in the hands of the right people who need to use it. Okay, let’s go listen to them.</p>

<h6 id="4257">42:57</h6>
<p>Let’s go convince them that we know what we’re doing and that we can go build what they want. Once we did that, okay, let’s look. Is it working? Cool, it’s working, there’s traction, they’re paying me.</p>

<h6 id="4307">43:07</h6>
<p>Okay, let me go convince an investor that I’m able to make $40 ,000 a quarter right now, but if they were to, if we were to work together and get some investment, we could blow this out to $100 ,000 a quarter.</p>

<h6 id="4320">43:20</h6>
<p>Right? That’s kind of the strategic high -level mindset. I mean, there’s a lot of things in the weeds, but I think that’s a good start framework. So there’s a few other things that we want to touch on as far as dark culture goes, as well as like assistance for women and minorities in this space.</p>

<h6 id="4340">43:40</h6>
<p>But one of the things that I’m so fascinated about is how do you, like after you get the idea, you build a product team, you kind of, you do market strategy, you have this kind of MVP and you’re looking for funding.</p>

<h6 id="4350">43:50</h6>
<p>I mean, what kind of guts does it take to step into a room with a PowerPoint in your team and ask for a million dollars? Just as easy to ask for a million as it is to ask for $10 ,000. Right. One of the big things you have to understand is really the economics of the game you’re playing.</p>

<h6 id="4405">44:05</h6>
<p>Right. When you’re talking to an investor that has invested in high growth tech companies, right, they’re really incentivized to go find the big retard. Right. The Airbnb, the Uber, the Dropbox. Right.</p>

<h6 id="4419">44:19</h6>
<p>What’s going to go be, what’s going to be go worth a billion dollars? And what’s going to 10X my money? What’s going to really, even better than 10X, right? If I give you $20 million, what kind of return am I going to get from that?</p>

<h6 id="4434">44:34</h6>
<p>Right. And so to a point to where it’s like, I actually can’t spend time on anything that’s actually not going to yield that kind of return. Right. So if you really understand venture capitalist, man, they see thousands of deals a year.</p>

<h6 id="4451">44:51</h6>
<p>Thousands, like literally a year, like coming across their emails, coming across their tables, they’re going to do hundreds of pitches, and they’re probably going to only invest in like seven or eight companies a year.</p>

<h6 id="4502">45:02</h6>
<p>Right. So they’re saying no way more than they’re saying yes. And they’re betting on like seven or eight. And of those seven or eight, maybe, you know, four or five don’t pan out. You know, one is going to kind of get them their money back at even and then one hopefully will be a big success years later down the road.</p>

<h6 id="4521">45:21</h6>
<p>Right. And so that’s the mindset of someone that is, that’s even stroking a million dollar check. Right. And so you’ve got to go in there going like, hey, not only do, you know, I have the idea and the product, but I also have the team that’s committed to get you that big return.</p>

<h6 id="4538">45:38</h6>
<p>Right. That’s what’s over playing. We’re here for the long haul to go catch that big wave. Right. We’re not here to go do something that is going to be small. And so I think, you know, people kind of underestimate that, but it’s like people don’t want to, if I would have said back in the day, you know, I want to just throw a water balloon fight on campus.</p>

<h6 id="4556">45:56</h6>
<p>Okay, cool. Let’s throw a water balloon fight. You want to go through the world’s largest water balloon play? Are you crazy? Right, right, right. Yeah, you kind of are. Let’s go get it and go home. You kind of are crazy, but I want to help you.</p>

<h6 id="4607">46:07</h6>
<p>I want to help you actually do that. I want to actually, I want to send you 300 ,000 balloons for free. This lady sent me 300 ,000 water balloons for free, right? Just because you asked. Yeah, but also the idea was big enough to where I was like, oh, that’s kind of cool.</p>

<h6 id="4621">46:21</h6>
<p>Like, I’m down, you know? So, so yeah, that’s, I can go deeper. We can have a hold of the podcast on going big, but yeah. Let’s do it. I’m coming next episode. Yeah, part two, volume two. So, so before we jump into marketing trends of 2020 and some maybe insight and tips to helping our listeners, what are some some assistance and programs that women and minorities can can capitalize in this space?</p>

<h6 id="4648">46:48</h6>
<p>Yeah, I know that’s a very important question. I’m glad you actually brought that up, to be honest. I think, you know, oftentimes, you know, I think… You know, we just people get overlooked right and you know, I think it’s down to a simple as hey, I’m right -handed and We made this whole thing great for right -handers, right?</p>

<h6 id="4710">47:10</h6>
<p>There’s gonna be a lot of left -handed people who are like what the hell like what is this is uncomfortable for me, right? I’m less than that. Yeah, can I can I please you know? And so there’s lots of subsets of people and I think it extends past race.</p>

<h6 id="4724">47:24</h6>
<p>I think you know goes into gender I think there’s obviously people with you know chronic disabilities and just kind of get overlooked And so there are a lot of great great great spaces. I think one that’s interesting if you have a company And you know to your point women and minority led there’s a new fund out there collab capital they’re out of Atlanta and We’ll put them in the show notes and they’re really focused on giving tools to people who just you know Probably historically don’t have the access to this information don’t come from a background where there are you know Their parents are business owners or they went to school with kids who you know went to college And so you know, there’s just a lot of resources out there Yeah, so the ton of opportunities.</p>

<h6 id="4807">48:07</h6>
<p>He’s gonna ask put yourself out there for sure for sure Awesome, man. I think that’s super insightful You know, I hope that you pause to take a take a breath because my brain is just full of startup knowledge now And I’m you know, it gets me excited about just thinking about you know, I did is that I have floating around for for startups and Just being able to just hear someone talk about I think just bring so much value and your level of confidence about how you approach things I think just Drives people to make those decisions that they step out of their comfort zone that that maybe before this podcast They they didn’t have the confidence or the the know -how or just the umph to kind of put that push them to that next level to say Yeah, yeah, this is something I need to believe in and and to take the proper steps and and to follow resources in the show knows to do so so You know, I’m just so excited up to see to see to have you back on the podcast again and something that is so fascinating to me is marketing trends and they are constantly changing.</p>

<h6 id="4907">49:07</h6>
<p>And I would love to get your insight on to what you saw back in 2019 and what to expect in 2020 that we can kind of get a heart of the curve on. Yeah, no, definitely. To Eli’s point, kind of a marketer by trade, right?</p>

<h6 id="4922">49:22</h6>
<p>And that’s probably what I’m most excited about is marketing when it comes down to it. And so, you know, I think we’re seeing a lot of different changes in marketing. I kind of joked with him earlier that everything that I think I was probably going to say is probably out the window now that you think about this kind of new, you know, new world that we’re about to be living in post coronavirus.</p>

<h6 id="4947">49:47</h6>
<p>But a lot of things are happening. I think, you know, if you’re from a marketing standpoint, if you are building something digitally, You really want to start building a community around your product.</p>

<h6 id="4958">49:58</h6>
<p>This can happen not just social media type companies, but if you’re doing software B to B type of work. I think most brands are able to build a community. What I mean by community is being able to create a safe space for people to communicate and talk and share values.</p>

<h6 id="5020">50:20</h6>
<p>Like a real deal community. It’s like, I’m safe in my community. It’s people that we get along and we think together and we ideate together. This is happening across the internet. Whether it be in Reddit forms, on Twitter, on Instagram, on YouTube, there are so many different.</p>

<h6 id="5039">50:39</h6>
<p>One of the awesome clients that I love bragging about is their Ryan and Rose. What they do is it’s a very simple business. They build extremely cute and adorable pacifiers and little tags and things for the babies.</p>

<h6 id="5054">50:54</h6>
<p>Literally this lady built this thing out of her house. She has devoted $0 to ads or retargeting campaigns. She’s been solely dependent on Instagram, Instagram stories to spread her message and spread her brand.</p>

<h6 id="5108">51:08</h6>
<p>She’s recently launched in Target, going to go global with the Target brand. She has over a million Instagram followers. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I mean, it just shows that community is so rich. Yep. Again, that’s a social, more consumer focus.</p>

<h6 id="5127">51:27</h6>
<p>She probably sees a lot more chatter, but I think you’re going to start seeing a lot of people try to get to community. The idea is just how do I really get to the real user that’s going to use it, that’s going to evangelize my product, that’s going to share it, that’s going to help me ideate on top of it.</p>

<h6 id="5146">51:46</h6>
<p>That is going to, that’s strong and that’s going to stay with you. During these tough times, imagine there’s probably a lot of places that are like, Damn, where do we go from here? Right? We just have to shut down business.</p>

<h6 id="5158">51:58</h6>
<p>Everyone’s at home for two weeks. Right. But when you start to have that like online community, they’re like, hey, we’re still rocking with you when you come back. You know, we’re still going to, you know, we’re still going to be here in full force with you rather than having to go spend marketing dollars.</p>

<h6 id="5211">52:11</h6>
<p>I think you’re also going to start seeing social media platform shift to like more creator first. And so what I mean by that is, you know, you can probably think about, you know, your style, so your auntie or your friend who has a corporate job, but now it’s starting to make some side money doing stuff on the internet.</p>

<h6 id="5230">52:30</h6>
<p>They’re a blogger, they’re a YouTuber. They do reviews. They, you know, do cooking tutorials, right? They kind of have their passion that they have and like what’s going to start happening. Yeah, the internet is going to start rewarding you for that passion.</p>

<h6 id="5245">52:45</h6>
<p>So if you think about it, the internet was, you know, it started rewarding you for your time at first, right? Hey, your time and your extra, your extra time and your extra space, right? I’ve got extra room in my car and I have extra time.</p>

<h6 id="5256">52:56</h6>
<p>So I’m going to pick you up with Uber. I’ve got an extra bedroom. I’m going to let you stay at my house at Airbnb. And so there are a lot of these platforms that like really rewarded you for having just extra time and extra space and extra stuff, right?</p>

<h6 id="5309">53:09</h6>
<p>And we could like share it with other people. Now you’re going to start seeing the internet where people for their passion. So, oh, you know how to cook well, you know how to style people well, you know, how to do graphic design well.</p>

<h6 id="5319">53:19</h6>
<p>You know how to travel the world on a budget really well, right? Okay, I want to learn from you. So like the internet is going to help you earn passive income off of providing and sharing that knowledge that you’re passionate about.</p>

<h6 id="5334">53:34</h6>
<p>And so you’re seeing it already with platforms like Patreon, of course. I think, you know, TikTok is another example again of, you know, if you’re going to be, if you’re going to be creating something, you know, creating it with the creator in mind, with that passionate person in mind first.</p>

<h6 id="5350">53:50</h6>
<p>So like Facebook, for example, didn’t really create the business model or even Instagram wasn’t really created so that, you know, someone could really make money. It was just, you know, post your photos and then we’re going to figure out how to make money on this, but like not the person you’re making the photos.</p>

<h6 id="5406">54:06</h6>
<p>So now it’s awkward to put the link in the bio. I need to swipe up. It’s awkward to make money on Facebook or on YouTube because it’s just not YouTube, but on, on Instagram because it just wasn’t built for me to like do that.</p>

<h6 id="5417">54:17</h6>
<p>And I think you’re going to start seeing people who win. They’re going to start building their platforms with the end creator in mind. So, you know, an example is like if I’m building something for a wardrobe stylist, right, um, to make money off of their knowledge of how to put together good outfits and that’s going to be an app or a website.</p>

<h6 id="5435">54:35</h6>
<p>I’m going to build features and make it really easy for the stylist to take payments via PayPal or Apple pay or whatever method or, you know, cryptocurrency. I’m going to make it really easy for them to organize their clients and emails.</p>

<h6 id="5450">54:50</h6>
<p>them and own their email addresses. I’m going to make it really easy for people to download that stylus tips and share it across the web. If you think about TikTok, what’s interesting about that platform is I can download someone’s TikTok and then I can put it on my Twitter so now it goes even more viral.</p>

<h6 id="5508">55:08</h6>
<p>But when you look at that, it has the creator’s TikTok username in the corner. So again, just small things that keep the creator first in mind. You’re going to start seeing that. So if you’re out there building for social consumer marketing, that’s I think a big key.</p>

<h6 id="5525">55:25</h6>
<p>Sure. So if I did a Google search, I’m not going to see some scooter TikToks out there? No, man. No TikToks yet. But it’s a pretty phenomenal. It’s a pretty phenomenal. phenomenal platform the creativity is rich.</p>

<h6 id="5538">55:38</h6>
<p>I mean it’s funny I remember when Vine came out and I remember people were like you know what is this Vine thing and you know like all these young kids are on Vine and now I feel that way. What are these young kids on TikTok?</p>

<h6 id="5549">55:49</h6>
<p>Like what the heck? So it’s a little scary to think that I might be like you know not too old for TikTok but I’m definitely wasn’t the first on the wave and I just can I can only imagine what you know next March when we’re sitting here talking what’s gonna be out next and it’s like yeah I’ve never even heard of that.</p>

<h6 id="5608">56:08</h6>
<p>Yeah I think people that are in a space and they start to get comfortable with a certain platform they are I wouldn’t say threatened or vulnerable to it but they feel like oh I’m not gonna do that that’s kind of like I like Facebook I like Instagram I’m familiar with that I think it’s not necessarily a tendency of us getting older and the new generation coming up with these new apps and stuff but I think it’s a big change and teenagers and stuff they’ll jump social media network to network every year and we saw that with you know we saw that with you know influencers and teenagers getting on Instagram and now they’re now they’re off Instagram then they went to Musically and then Musically I bought out and now it’s TikTok and then you know all the the younger folks got off Facebook because they said Facebook is for older folks it’s you know you start to see these little these niches pop up and these communities based on demographic and you know looking to build a brand you got to obviously look at was it demographic on that platform and it’s just something that I can pitch to versus no I want to mention this last podcast but instead of oh I’m gonna go off and build a random website and hopefully people find me.</p>

<h6 id="5715">57:15</h6>
<p>Yeah no for sure right and and I think you know that’s the beautiful part too of like you know if you can also think about the opposite of that right is you know we’re also getting older right and so how is life gonna look when we are 70 80 90 right what platforms are we gonna be using to track our medicine to keep up with our grandkids and great kids to, you know, be Alzheimer’s or whatever diseases we’re having, right?</p>

<h6 id="5742">57:42</h6>
<p>And so how do you start building for that as well? So yeah, I mean, like you’re totally right, the landscape is always changing. And I think, but, but there’s like a lot of opportunity in that, right?</p>

<h6 id="5753">57:53</h6>
<p>I think, you know, again, the time that comes around, I just want to have my VR headset on. I want to Netflix and chill all day, you know, consume my love at first sight episodes, and, and just hang out and pop my meds, you know, Yeah, look, that’s a simple life, man.</p>

<h6 id="5810">58:10</h6>
<p>Simple, simple, simple life. It’ll get there, man. It’s going to get there at some point. Scooter, I’m so appreciative of you coming on. I want to I want to wrap this episode up with some rapid fire questions.</p>

<h6 id="5824">58:24</h6>
<p>And it sounds like, you know, there’s, there’s much more to dive into it. And we’d love to have you on for a future episode. So let’s let’s get into it. You’re ready for some rapid fire. Let’s go. Let’s go.</p>

<h6 id="5836">58:36</h6>
<p>I’m really let’s do all right. What is your favorite social platform and why? Twitter hands down Twitter hands down the conversation on there is comical informative I get my news from Twitter. I think it’s it’s it’s such a powerful platform So Twitter hands down all day.</p>

<h6 id="5856">58:56</h6>
<p>No no IGTV No, no, no Twitter. It’s easy to use. It’s just like it’s just it’s quick It’s just like it’s good every time I I might pay for it like I like if Twitter came out and said like 799 pro option I might have to You know cut out my Netflix and like switch it to Awesome, he’s hooked.</p>

<h6 id="5918">59:18</h6>
<p>So what is the best way to start networking? The best way to start networking I mean, you know, there are people out there that are doing what you want to do and are talking about what you want, right?</p>

<h6 id="5929">59:29</h6>
<p>You’re not the only person that wants to go start a company or that wants to go work on something in this space And so I would say the first thing is really go connect with those types of people, right?</p>

<h6 id="5939">59:39</h6>
<p>If we wanted to go to the NBA we would go to a million sports camps and go be around people and travel around And so I think that’s part of it and you know, beautiful thing now a lot of the digital So, you know, go find again Twitter chats or Reddit chats or forums or you know Is there a technology group that meets every month at a local brewery in your hometown?</p>

<h6 id="5958">59:58</h6>
<p>I’m pretty sure there is right who has started a company that’s done well Who is also from your hometown? I mean like these are great places to kind of go start and go just reach out and say hey, you know, my name is blah blah blah I’m currently building this And you know and like network properly.</p>

<h6 id="010017">01:00:17</h6>
<p>So don’t just say I want to pick your brain That’s probably the you know top worst thing you could say but be you know specific like hey, you know I think I’m thinking about building this product I’m having a hard time around X topic right can we talk for 30 minutes this week to talk more about?</p>

<h6 id="010035">01:00:35</h6>
<p>about it. If not, you know, hey, who else do you know that could help me? I think what’s even better is just ask the question in the email. I think, I think in your to your point, you know, Eli and Kenny about, you know, being out in the ocean, so many people spend their time like just waxing their surfboard and like dreaming about being out there when it’s like, yo, just stop trying to like go get lunch with it, like ask them like, hey, I have a problem with X.</p>

<h6 id="010101">01:01:01</h6>
<p>Can you help me do boom, boom, boom? Here are the three things I need help with, right? And then they might say, oh, wow, here’s a book I read. You should go meet this person and watch this Ted talk.</p>

<h6 id="010111">01:01:11</h6>
<p>Right? You know, just go ahead and just ask, right? Like, you know, there are a lot of like people, it doesn’t have to be perfect or just more so like you don’t have to like, I like this call like my again, another gym from one of my investors, but you know, let’s get a home run one base at a time.</p>

<h6 id="010130">01:01:30</h6>
<p>Right. Um, and so yeah, I know what we want. I know we want to do home run, but like one base at a time. And so I need to go ask that question and go meet that person. You go do this and do that and like, just, just go attack.</p>

<h6 id="010141">01:01:41</h6>
<p>Um, so yeah, long answer. I love that, um, that follow up you said, which if someone says, you know, I know it’s not necessarily a no to you. Maybe they just don’t have time right now to, to, to talk or invest time right now.</p>

<h6 id="010154">01:01:54</h6>
<p>Or maybe they’re just busy or a different headspace, but to say, okay, maybe you don’t have time, but is it, can you connect with me? Somebody else, do you, who else can I talk to about this? And, you know, they’re going to have wisdom and knowledge connections in this space.</p>

<h6 id="010205">01:02:05</h6>
<p>And so instead of just taking a no for a no, kind of rolling off of that, letting that, that no roll off you and say, okay, how else can I turn this into a further networking possibility? And that, that, um, that sense of hunger, I think comes across and is addicting.</p>

<h6 id="010219">01:02:19</h6>
<p>And people are like, Oh wow, that, that kid’s got, that kid’s got heart. The kids got grind and, um, you know, you know, that they’ll probably reconsider and possibly even reach out back to you if you just shoot him an email.</p>

<h6 id="010230">01:02:30</h6>
<p>So I love that. Um, so you mentioned, you know, they might advertise, uh, or, or mention a book or recommend a book. What is one book that has changed your life? Hmm. Uh, there’s this book called Crucial Conversations.</p>

<h6 id="010244">01:02:44</h6>
<p>Um, really good book. Uh, I used to shy away from conflict. Um, so when you’re, you know, running a startup, we have to make decisions every day, right? Down from like what color should the logo be to, you know, product decisions to are we going to reach out to investors for money?</p>

<h6 id="010301">01:03:01</h6>
<p>Like you got to make clear, concise, you have to make clear decisions every day. And a startup and you have to make, you know, you want to make the right ones. And sometimes you’re not going to make the right ones, but the big thing is making a clear decision.</p>

<h6 id="010313">01:03:13</h6>
<p>Um, I think where shit goes wrong is when it’s just like in decision and you kind of wait a week to make a decision, uh, because it’s just not pretty, right? And I think this book also extends past being in a startup, but also like if you have a wife or a husband or you have a child.</p>

<h6 id="010330">01:03:30</h6>
<p>right you kind of understand like okay we got to make decisions here we can’t sit in this angst or this weird funk of us not you know making decisions and having difficult conversations that lead to these decisions right and so that was a big book for me that it’s called crucial conversations it just gave me a lot of like cool phrases and tools and and just you know how to think about oh shit I got to go tell Kenny that like this idea is not gonna work you know and I know he loves it and so like how do I go approach that situation when I know that it’s like maybe emotional for him or you know like he’s been thinking about this since the beginning and now we got to cut it like you know like how do I let him know this you know and so super important for anyone that I think wants to be in startups because like you know it’s just like you have to have those conversations and you got to have them daily quickly and they got to be clear And so that book is one that changed my life.</p>

<h6 id="010431">01:04:31</h6>
<p>I went from not being confident about having difficult conversations to the next day, like, I’m ready. What’s up? Let’s argue. Yeah. I have a tendency to kind of shy away from a confrontation. So I’m totally going to check that out.</p>

<h6 id="010447">01:04:47</h6>
<p>And then I’ll be in the show notes. Yeah, no, please. Please check it out. We can definitely talk about it. I’d love to talk to you. Cool. Well, I do have a few wrap up questions for you too, Scooter.</p>

<h6 id="010458">01:04:58</h6>
<p>So my first one. What’s your best piece of marketing advice for somebody who’s just starting to get into it or wants to get into marketing? Ooh, best piece of marketing advice. I think some of it is like, go study some of the brands you admire.</p>

<h6 id="010515">01:05:15</h6>
<p>Marketing is everywhere. Everyone’s marketing. Some of the best companies do it subtly. They do it repeatedly. And so go look at some of those brands and really think deeply of why you use those brands or why you lean towards picking that up.</p>

<h6 id="010533">01:05:33</h6>
<p>And just then tie it back to a strategy, a marketing kind of like strategy. You can find those on the web, whether it be Apple or McDonald’s or whatever you’re eating or using. I think another thing too is study people.</p>

<h6 id="010550">01:05:50</h6>
<p>Marketing is really fundamentally about people. And so you’re not doing anything new that hasn’t been done before. I think what’s interesting is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for the March on Washington.</p>

<h6 id="010604">01:06:04</h6>
<p>Thousands of people, so many people showed up to hear him say, I have a dream speech. We’re just phenomenal. He had that happen without any Twitter, without any Facebook, without any of that stuff. So how did he get tens of thousands of people to show up and travel?</p>

<h6 id="010620">01:06:20</h6>
<p>Not by plane, but by bus and by car and without cell phones. And you could have all these tools and resources. in technology and you could barely have 40 people show up to your event, right? Or you could barely sell three t -shirts in a week, right?</p>

<h6 id="010638">01:06:38</h6>
<p>And this man had. And so like what was that? And I think it really was that the essence was just understanding people and humans and how do you unite people around an idea and then move them. So study psychology, study sociology, human behavior, you know, there’s a lot of things that are directly tied to marketing in that.</p>

<h6 id="010700">01:07:00</h6>
<p>Awesome, man. Really good advice. Speaking of advice, have you received any great tips or what was your best piece of advice from like an investor or a VC? Oh, man, so, so many. And I think I appreciate them now that I’m not in the company.</p>

<h6 id="010718">01:07:18</h6>
<p>When I was in the company, it’s like, I didn’t want to hear any of this, like stop telling me this stuff. You know, I think one of the biggest things someone told me was, you know, again, same investor who kind of told me a lot of this stuff.</p>

<h6 id="010732">01:07:32</h6>
<p>As you can see, I spent a lot of time with him. He said, you know, people can handle bad news if you give them enough time to process it. And so, you know, oftentimes in startups, and I think it goes back to crucial conversations and just like just all around communication, right?</p>

<h6 id="010751">01:07:51</h6>
<p>Like, you are trying to build this company. You’re trying to build this thing with team, employees, investors, your wife or your husband is supporting you, your family supporting you, your friends are using your product.</p>

<h6 id="010803">01:08:03</h6>
<p>And so just all around communication about expectations, about what’s working, what’s not working is really important. And so, you know, when things don’t go wrong, like, you know, try to go alert the necessary people right away.</p>

<h6 id="010817">01:08:17</h6>
<p>And, you know, don’t make it sound like it’s a fire and like, you need to like put everything down. But like, you know, how do you have constant clear communication? Is that weekly updates with your investors or monthly updates?</p>

<h6 id="010828">01:08:28</h6>
<p>Where every month you say, here’s how much cash I have in the bank. Here’s what we’re doing. Here’s how many customers I have. Next month you say the same thing. Next month you say the same thing. So by month four, when you say, oh, three of my customers pulled out because of coronavirus and I don’t have enough money to pay my employees past April, right, that investor now has enough updates to see what was going right and what was going wrong, right?</p>

<h6 id="010853">01:08:53</h6>
<p>Instead of just emailing them out of the blue going, hey, remember me? Yeah, I’m out of money now. You’re like, what the heck? What happened? Like, how did this happen? Like, how did you let this get to this level?</p>

<h6 id="010903">01:09:03</h6>
<p>And so, so yeah, so people can handle bad news if you just give them enough time to kind of like process it and deal with it and try to figure it out. There’s so many more gems, but that was one that I think I’ll share.</p>

<h6 id="010918">01:09:18</h6>
<p>Right on. Well, one last one last one that I’m interested to hear about since you’re such a tech head. is what is your first impressions of the Cybertruck? First impressions of the Cybertruck was, do I have $100 in my bank account to reserve my spot?</p>

<h6 id="010941">01:09:41</h6>
<p>No, I mean, yeah, no, it was great, man. I think they’re doing some real cool innovation. It’s a little weird looking. It doesn’t have side mirrors, I don’t know, but it was legit. And I think, you know, kind of inspiring too.</p>

<h6 id="010959">01:09:59</h6>
<p>Again, sitting in like an entrepreneur lane, right? That is kind of inspiring that this guy keeps making hits. He treats, in the words of Jay -Z, right? He treats every song like his first song, right?</p>

<h6 id="011018">01:10:18</h6>
<p>And he’s not afraid to like, Fail and mess up but like he keeps putting care and attention and he like just keeps producing too, right? He’s not like resting on his like past wins and I think that’s just like mad inspiring.</p>

<h6 id="011033">01:10:33</h6>
<p>It’s like yeah I want to create something like that Innovating and I have a team like that and have confidence like that So I you know that’s it’s more than to me then which again I think you know Eli and I saw that with Steve when he was coming out with like a new Apple product every June It was like damn the iPhone 3gs and now the 4 and now FaceTime and now the iPad and it was just so much stuff And it was like okay great like let’s keep let’s keep that pace too.</p>

<hr class="dash mt-0 mb-2" />

<h6 id="0000">00:00</h6>
<p>You’re listening to the Plaid Pixel podcast with your host, Eli Brumley and Ken Blasco. Let’s enter the world of web design, development and so much more. And welcome back to the Plaid Pixel podcast.</p>

<h6 class="mb-0">00:20</h6>
<p>We are so excited for today’s guest. With his passion for video and experience in digital marketing, Trent is crafting brands through storytelling and rich media. It’s Trent Arwin. Trent, thanks for coming on.</p>

<h6 id="0031">00:31</h6>
<p>How are you? Man, thank you guys so much for having me. I’m so pumped to talk about this. I love video. I love integrating that with marketing. So whenever I get an opportunity to talk about this, and I was so excited, you asked me to do it because I haven’t been I haven’t been able to have the chance to do like stream of consciousness about this topic.</p>

<h6 id="0049">00:49</h6>
<p>So I’m super excited. Podcast platform is the best way to do that. Yeah, let’s get into it. I’m so excited. Cool. So a few a few topics just to kind of warm you up. You know, if you want to dive into how you got into video, what drives you to video and what what you’re most excited about in 2020?</p>

<h6 id="0107">01:07</h6>
<p>For sure. Yeah, I think this is foundational for some of the other stuff that hopefully we’ll cover in this. I got started in video through my background in journalism. So I studied journalism in college, which really revolved around good storytelling and good writing.</p>

<h6 id="0123">01:23</h6>
<p>So in journalism school, they’re all about how to write and tell a good story. Obviously, it’s, you know, fact, fact based and it’s not in terms of business or marketing, but it was really about just how do you capture the essence of what’s going on and share that in a way that people are actually going to want to consume it.</p>

<h6 id="0139">01:39</h6>
<p>So I got really good at writing and I was doing a ton of digital marketing at the time, just just to kind of get my chops in the space. And so I was, I was writing just article after article after article for different online brands.</p>

<h6 id="0154">01:54</h6>
<p>I was doing everything from, gosh, plastic surgery. to treats for dogs, to just like the most random crap. I was doing so many articles, but what it taught me was just how to create really quick, good content, how to do really good research and then put it in a way that could be posted like on a blog or it could be done in like searching and optimization.</p>

<h6 id="0220">02:20</h6>
<p>So I was just really learning how to just produce content which really is foundational in the video space as well. So I got really good at just writing and telling things. And during journalism school, we messed around with cameras and I thought cameras were interesting, but I didn’t know anything about cameras.</p>

<h6 id="0238">02:38</h6>
<p>Like I didn’t know what shutter speed was. I didn’t know what the iris was. Yeah, all this stuff. I didn’t know what it was. I was just like, whoa, like megapixels, cool. And I can, you know. Yeah, point and shoot.</p>

<h6 id="0251">02:51</h6>
<p>There’s lenses and like shallow depth of field, this thing they call Bokeh. So that just kind of got me intrigued. intrigued and so the writing kind of carried me and got me going as far as like a career was concerned because that led into like you said digital marketing and so I was doing SEO and doing blog posts for clients.</p>

<h6 id="0310">03:10</h6>
<p>But on the side I was like really most intrigued by video and creating that and so I was just dabbling in it trying to shoot things here and there as I could honestly I got into doing weddings first, which is where a lot of videographers get started.</p>

<h6 id="0325">03:25</h6>
<p>Because yeah people are getting married all the time there’s always somebody getting married. Friends and family, whomever is getting married and at the time I actually got paid for my first wedding that I did but it was off of the backs of off the back of another friend who was also kind of dabbling a video and he’s like hey do you think we could do a wedding video together and I’m like heck why not you know like I think us together we could pull it off and sure and what was crazy was that first wedding video that we did was actually not bad at all it was really good.</p>

<h6 id="0356">03:56</h6>
<p>So that got me super pumped was like dang like we just got paid for this this is a really good video. I was so furiously passionate at that point because like I created something kind of on my first strike that was that was pretty good.</p>

<h6 id="0413">04:13</h6>
<p>And something that I would even go back to and point now and be like you know like yeah I can see the things that I didn’t didn’t do well but just looking at it from that perspective would just be like man like that was a good piece of work.</p>

<h6 id="0423">04:23</h6>
<p>Even on my first try and so wedding videos led me into considering how I could use video and storytelling for brands. Obviously there are massive production companies you know there’s a massive production company in here by the here in the area called Running Pony and I kind of was always looking up to that.</p>

<h6 id="0440">04:40</h6>
<p>You know and they charge day rates of like $10 ,000 or $15 ,000. Yeah I mean just crazy amounts of money and I’m like there’s got to be a place in the market here in Memphis for you know for brands that don’t want to spend that much money for video but they want to have video content.</p>

<h6 id="0459">04:59</h6>
<p>sure, you know who we’re gonna spend $1 ,000 $2 ,000 maybe $5 ,000 and I’m like I I think I could touch in that space you know I think I could really fill a void that exists here and that’s that’s kind of what led me to you know Eli where you and I met working at speak I kind of just pitched myself as like hey you know I would love to come bring a new service to this organization and luckily I got hired there and that really just like snowballed into a whole lot of things and just really opened me up to more clientele and new projects and just getting my chops cut again and like just learning so much more about video and how to tell that and just getting down and dirty with all these different projects and some of them were great some of them not so great there’s some work that I’m not proud of or you know it wasn’t horrible but just things that I just wasn’t super proud of and then things that I was really really proud of part of that part of going into into the agency space is this you know, regardless of how fast paced it is, you really get to to build a portfolio and you get to dabble in so many different areas of the market.</p>

<h6 id="0606">06:06</h6>
<p>And it’s it typically don’t get to do that when you’re working for a large 4 ,500 corporate agency or company. And, you know, you’re really in that instance, you’re focused on kind of one brand, one vision.</p>

<h6 id="0617">06:17</h6>
<p>So you’re kind of creatively blocked. And so an agency is just like run and gun, you know, you just run and go go go fast pays all the time. And so in that sense, I hate it. But in that sense, it was really helpful for me to to be able to be running and gunning in so many different spaces with different clients, because I really kind of started to learn like what was working for clients and what wasn’t, which really kind of helped me when I decided to leave that and go out on my own.</p>

<h6 id="0645">06:45</h6>
<p>You know, I learned I figured out what does the sales process look like? I know how do I execute on doing sales? How do I execute on planning a project? You know, so that was something that I really learned while I was at speak was how do I plan effectively and communicate that?</p>

<h6 id="0659">06:59</h6>
<p>I already kind of knew how to shoot, but I really got way better at shooting stuff. I learned like what equipment I really needed and which equipment was more just kind of dazzle, razzle dazzle. So things like that I learned at an agency and like, like I said, like I’m very thankful for that.</p>

<h6 id="0716">07:16</h6>
<p>But then I also realized like, wow, I was doing a lot by myself there and I can do that myself. Yeah, so you touched a little bit on obviously storytelling, having your background in journalism, which I think is just the foundation of anything when it comes to building a brand and and doing, you know, a strategic push for for digital, you know, online presences is having that having that brand and that consistent voice across all your platforms, regardless of the media type.</p>

<h6 id="0745">07:45</h6>
<p>If it’s blog posting, if it’s just copy on a website or even if it’s, you know, full blown video production, having that consistent voice is obviously what people fall in love with. And that’s why you follow brands and you buy from those brands because it’s that it’s that feeling you get.</p>

<h6 id="0800">08:00</h6>
<p>It’s that that emotion that it that it strikes because of the experience that you might have had with that person’s product or right, right. Digital presence. Storytelling is the term is such a buzzword these days, you know, I wish it wasn’t necessarily a buzzword because it is a good word.</p>

<h6 id="0816">08:16</h6>
<p>um, telling a story is so found. I mean, it’s from the foundation of time, really, the existence of humanity is like telling stories. Uh, you know, whether you’re around a campfire in a cave, um, to, you know, telling a story on YouTube now, um, it’s so foundation for the way that we communicate and the way that we relate.</p>

<h6 id="0834">08:34</h6>
<p>Like, uh, and I think that’s a big thing that people have to understand is like social media is about relation and relationships. And so video and telling stories is how we connect, um, the actual content.</p>

<h6 id="0846">08:46</h6>
<p>Like storytelling is the content. And that’s, so when you’re not telling story and you’re just speaking at people, well, you feel like you’re at like a political rally or something, you know, or just something, uh, mundane, you know, or like you’re, you’re like, you know, you’re in a lecture hall in school, you know, like your, your professors just speaking at you.</p>

<h6 id="0905">09:05</h6>
<p>It’s not engaging. Something that resonates. Yeah. Yeah. Building something that resonates. Um, I know, like when I’ve gone to, to hear somebody speak, it’s always when they first start with like a story, whether it’s hilarious or it’s dramatic or it’s, um, you know, Tinder, hearted or whatever it is.</p>

<h6 id="0923">09:23</h6>
<p>Like if they start with a story, then they typically capture your, your attention. Yeah. Plus it’s a good icebreaker. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So you don’t, I mean, you don’t have to go to journalism school to learn how to tell a good story.</p>

<h6 id="0934">09:34</h6>
<p>Really. Like it just comes down to beginning, middle and end, you know, like, and it doesn’t have to be a long story. It doesn’t have to be a complex story. You just need to get the, the, the beginning, the middle, on the end.</p>

<h6 id="0945">09:45</h6>
<p>You need to establish it. You need to establish who the characters are, what the problem is. Um, because the problem is like what’s going to create the conflict. And so you need conflict. Yeah, exactly.</p>

<h6 id="0956">09:56</h6>
<p>You need conflict and then you need resolution. And so a lot of times marketing is on the resolution. And so, uh, marketing is speaking to the problem that somebody’s experiencing. You know, like you have dirty clothes.</p>

<h6 id="1008">10:08</h6>
<p>And you need laundry detergent, you know, so like we’re going to, we created a clean laundry detergent that’s going to make your clothes, you know, not be full of chemicals. and it’s going to smell awesome.</p>

<h6 id="1018">10:18</h6>
<p>So marketing a lot of times is about that resolution. So you can’t have good resolution without good conflict. And again, that’s just storytelling. It’s just beginning, middle and end characters, conflicts and resolving that conflict and trying to as a brand when you’re marketing showing people how you can resolve and help them in that conflict for them through the product and services that you offer.</p>

<h6 id="1039">10:39</h6>
<p>Cool. This is awesome insight into the market and obviously anybody that’s looking to get into the rich media side of the world as far as digital marketing and telling stories. I know you touched on storytelling as key, the background of why you should story tell, proposing a problem and telling a story through a solution to sell a product or or to become engaged.</p>

<h6 id="1104">11:04</h6>
<p>I want to get it down into the rudimentary level of the tools that you’re using on a day to day, you know, music, audio, editing, what does that look like, and how can someone’s interested in even dabbling in this or wants to get into the industry?</p>

<h6 id="1118">11:18</h6>
<p>How are those things so vital to your portfolio and your kind of your tool belt? Right, right. Yeah. So for me now, you know, doing full time video production and photography, the great news is that it’s more affordable than ever.</p>

<h6 id="1133">11:33</h6>
<p>You know, that’s what I tell people all the time is that like, it doesn’t mean that you have to charge so much less. I mean, you typically do charge less unless you’re one of those massive companies and you have a full production crew.</p>

<h6 id="1144">11:44</h6>
<p>But right now in 2020, it’s the cheapest that it’s ever been and it’s probably going to continue to get cheaper just because the technology is cheaper and the ability to do it, the tools and what you do it are just easy and cheaper to have access to.</p>

<h6 id="1158">11:58</h6>
<p>So yeah, I mean, everything from I use Adobe cloud for all the stuff, you know, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Illustrator, things like that. It just works really well. I know the programs and then I know a lot of designers and other creatives are using Adobe, so it just integrates really well.</p>

<h6 id="1214">12:14</h6>
<p>Then like music licensing, like that has gotten so much better in the last five years. There are so many platforms now that offer good music, you know, at a good rate so you can pay a subscription and get good good music.</p>

<h6 id="1228">12:28</h6>
<p>So that’s obviously key to editing and having a really good video is whatever kind of mood you’re conveying through the music. So that’s music and then cameras, you know, cameras, there’s so many different brands these days.</p>

<h6 id="1244">12:44</h6>
<p>I mean, Sony, Canon, Blackmagic, you have all these different brands that are just competing so hardcore to make a great camera with great specs and like, again, they’re making it cheaper and cheaper.</p>

<h6 id="1256">12:56</h6>
<p>So, I mean, you can really get started with a quality camera, probably around $700 to $1 ,000. And, you know, even some of the stuff that I shoot on, it’s not all that great. always like $10 ,000. It can be more in the like $3 ,000 to $4 ,000 range.</p>

<h6 id="1312">13:12</h6>
<p>But you can certainly shoot something good on a $1 ,000 camera or a $700 camera. And then it just comes down to kind of the lenses that you’re using. So the thing, the appeal in good video is depth of field.</p>

<h6 id="1327">13:27</h6>
<p>And again, going back to things that I didn’t understand, depth of field is controlled by your aperture and your aperture is determined by the lens in which you use. So lenses that have a greater aperture are going to be more expensive.</p>

<h6 id="1340">13:40</h6>
<p>There are some cheaper versions. Like I have a Canon 100 or no Canon 50 millimeter here on my shelf that I started out with. It was like 200 bucks. And it gave me great depth of field and was allowed me to have that cinematic feel.</p>

<h6 id="1357">13:57</h6>
<p>So I mean, you can totally do these things on a budget these days. You just have to be willing to put some money forward. Obviously, I tried to tell people not to go into debt, but if you are willing to maybe want to finance a few things, B &amp;H Photo is the best place for you to get gear.</p>

<h6 id="1415">14:15</h6>
<p>And B &amp;H Photo offers a kind of a credit card where you can actually do financing. And so if you can get approved for that, then, you know, if money is really a problem for you to get going, I actually have one of those credit cards because it allows me to get some gear, test it out, and I can actually finance it with no interest for a little while.</p>

<h6 id="1433">14:33</h6>
<p>So a little plug for B &amp;H because they’re awesome. Show some love. Yeah, but I’m just saying, like, you know, if you don’t have the cash right away, I am a believer in that if you have a dream and you feel like you are equipped and you have skills, like sometimes you just need a little bit of financial boost and that can help you.</p>

<h6 id="1450">14:50</h6>
<p>I’m not saying go crazy and, you know, buy a red camera that’s going to cost 15 to 20 grand and just put it on a credit card. But I’m saying if you don’t have $1 ,000 laying around, but you know this is what you want to do, test that out, try it out, go and get something and, you know, give it your whole heart and your whole effort.</p>

<h6 id="1508">15:08</h6>
<p>But it’s cheaper than ever, which is awesome. So if someone doesn’t maybe want to go down the full spectrum of gear and lenses and all that stuff, you know, I mean, with everybody owning a smartphone now that has really complex 4K cameras, you know, all these things are getting more kind of, quote, depth of field.</p>

<h6 id="1527">15:27</h6>
<p>A lot of that is digital, depth of field versus actual lenses, but you’re getting similar results. You know, something that I think is so fascinating about the area. Right. Again, people get caught up in specs, you know, and we get caught up in specs of like the new iPhone, you know, is that 4K?</p>

<h6 id="1544">15:44</h6>
<p>Is it going to have 6K? Is it going to have 8K? You know, with frame rates. So people get so caught up in specs and I get caught up in specs because specs are flashy, you know, they help sell something.</p>

<h6 id="1553">15:53</h6>
<p>But you don’t even have to shoot. I don’t even shoot 4K all the time. I still shoot 1080 on a lot of stuff. Again, it comes down to if you can have like, if you have like an iPhone 10 or an iPhone 11, or even an iPhone 8, you know, you can shoot good quality video.</p>

<h6 id="1609">16:09</h6>
<p>Then it really comes down to some major aspects like audio. You know, if you’re across the room from an iPhone and you’re trying to talk to the iPhone, your audio is going to sound like crap. You’re going to sound like you’re in a massive space.</p>

<h6 id="1621">16:21</h6>
<p>And, you know, people aren’t going to people aren’t going to be able to hear it very well. So invest in a decent microphone. You know, if you’re just filming yourself at your desk or at a table and there’s microphones that you can plug into your phone, there’s microphones that you can plug into your computer.</p>

<h6 id="1636">16:36</h6>
<p>Very cool. I know so many YouTubers and stuff like that who actually just use a like a USB mic like what I’m recording on right now. And they just plug that in and then they’ll use maybe a camera or they’ll use a phone and just record.</p>

<h6 id="1650">16:50</h6>
<p>And then in post, they’ll just sync it up, you know, because quality audio. can really make the difference in a video. And then beyond that, quality lighting, you know, really makes the difference. So you don’t always have to have a nice big softbox lights put up, but just position yourself in a room or position yourself at home in the right way to where the light is on you.</p>

<h6 id="1711">17:11</h6>
<p>Like don’t have all these crazy shadows, don’t be in a super dark room. There’s just things like that that you have to learn in terms of good composition, good imagery. And again, it doesn’t matter whether you’re capturing it on an iPhone 11 or, you know, a red camera.</p>

<h6 id="1726">17:26</h6>
<p>If you get those things wrong, it’s gonna look terrible on both. So just understand lighting, understand you need good clean audio and that doesn’t cost a whole lot of money. Like I think the microphone I’m using right now costs like a hundred bucks.</p>

<h6 id="1739">17:39</h6>
<p>You could probably get one for $50 on Amazon and just plug it in. And then, yeah, you’re gonna have to figure out how to sync up that audio with your camera audio. But again, there’s just things that you’re gonna have to learn.</p>

<h6 id="1750">17:50</h6>
<p>But there’s things like that. Like, yeah, you don’t have to spend a whole lot of money. You just maybe go get, spend a little bit of money on like a Udemy course and learn from some, or go to YouTube, honestly, and just do it for free.</p>

<h6 id="1802">18:02</h6>
<p>And like search Peter McKinnon or somebody like that and learn how to do good composition and that you can do killer stuff on an iPhone. So I know you mentioned YouTube and something that I was so excited to dive into on the podcast is what is YouTube doing for brands and SEO in general?</p>

<h6 id="1821">18:21</h6>
<p>I mean, why is that such a, why is video production and telling stories through rich content so important now than ever? Right, right. Well, I mean, get this, like people watch over a billion hours of video on YouTube every single day.</p>

<h6 id="1837">18:37</h6>
<p>Every single day. I mean, there’s a billion users, or roughly a billion users on YouTube, which is about a third of the internet. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google and Google owns YouTube.</p>

<h6 id="1849">18:49</h6>
<p>So in terms of search engine optimization, Google is not gonna say that they’re gonna say gonna give you higher priority or more credibility if you have a YouTube channel or if you have YouTube videos.</p>

<h6 id="1900">19:00</h6>
<p>But I mean, it’s pretty clear. Like if they own YouTube, they’re gonna want you to be on YouTube. Right. Except for Google Plus. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that’s dead. Thank God. Thank God. So yeah, I mean, it’s kind of like a no brainer if you’re considering video content.</p>

<h6 id="1916">19:16</h6>
<p>Just go to YouTube. It’s free. It’s the second largest search engine. So many people are consuming it. Like having a channel on YouTube literally doesn’t cost you anything. You just need to create a Google account.</p>

<h6 id="1930">19:30</h6>
<p>If you don’t already have one, if you have a Gmail, then boom, you already have it and just go set up YouTube. But I will say, as far as like YouTube is concerned, like it’s pretty clear. You have to be in it for the long game, you know?</p>

<h6 id="1941">19:41</h6>
<p>It’s like with SEO, it’s like searching and optimization. You can’t just post something on your blog and be like, ah, come on, people, like, come read it. You know, why am I not number one on searching?</p>

<h6 id="1950">19:50</h6>
<p>So it’s like something- My message is very important. Yeah, read, read, read, read it. So like, you have to be in it for the long game. It’s definitely not a sprint. Like I’ve heard other YouTubers who are wildly successful now say that they did YouTube for a whole year.</p>

<h6 id="2005">20:05</h6>
<p>And, you know, maybe only had 150 subscribers, you know? And then in that second year, then they reached like maybe 20 ,000 subscribers, you know? So you have to just be willing with like subpar results in that first year or just really terrible results that first year, knowing that it’s the long game and it’s the consistency that’s gonna get you somewhere.</p>

<h6 id="2024">20:24</h6>
<p>So if you’re not willing to do the long game, then I honestly just say, just don’t do it yet. Because if you’re not ready to commit to it, then it’s not gonna be beneficial for you. I really wanna start a YouTube channel with my wife and my family, cause we’re about to have another child.</p>

<h6 id="2039">20:39</h6>
<p>And I think- That’s fun. Being able to do, yeah, being able to do video, I think there’s a way that we could integrate those things of like having a family and being parents and just sharing a message with people and reviewing things.</p>

<h6 id="2051">20:51</h6>
<p>Like I really wanna do it. But in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself, like you have to be committed to this. Like if you’re not gonna be committed to this for at least one year, then just don’t even start, honestly.</p>

<h6 id="2101">21:01</h6>
<p>So I don’t tell that to people to scare them away. I’m just saying that like, if you think that YouTube could be a marketing driver for you, whether you have an existing brand, or whether you want that to be your brand, you gotta be in it for the long game.</p>

<h6 id="2117">21:17</h6>
<p>And just go ahead and commit from day one that like if you only get like 10 views on that first video, that’s not a loss. You know, you didn’t lose. Like you won because you put a video out there. You know?</p>

<h6 id="2129">21:29</h6>
<p>You probably learned something about the craft in the process. Oh, for sure. Yeah, I mean, it literally just- Each video’s gonna get better and better and better. Yeah, just make videos, make videos, make videos.</p>

<h6 id="2139">21:39</h6>
<p>Like I have to remind myself even that even while I’m making videos for clients now I’m like if I want to make content for myself or just things like passion projects I just have to remind myself just like just make just make just make because otherwise Yeah, I mean you just know as a creative like you just get in your own mind and you’re like what if this is gonna be you know complete crap So I mean like just yeah, just don’t get in your own mind as far as like just just make just put it out there People are gonna tell you like one thing or another and you’re gonna learn you’re gonna kind of find your way Like once you once you get into several videos You will find your way and kind of find how you like saying and telling things and that’ll kind of become your own style Like you may not know your style in the beginning, but trust me like after several videos You’ll start to realize like I like doing this and I don’t like doing this and you’ll find you’ll start to find your style So something Trent that I think is so fascinating.</p>

<h6 id="2231">22:31</h6>
<p>I think YouTube’s obviously is the kind of king of video king of media because I mean There’s a reason why Google bought it for billions of dollars and it continues to invest into Showing those those kind of video snippets and SEO results You know versus having to actually read a detailed article step by step to yeah to accomplish something But something that I think is is is on the horizon and you know, and I want your opinion on this is Instagram You know, obviously there’s Facebook video.</p>

<h6 id="2255">22:55</h6>
<p>There’s all these other social media platforms But you know, how do you utilize this storytelling with the smartphone straight to Instagram telling stories? You know filling your feed and and just being engaging me What what’s something besides Google that’s this that’s a reward to spend your time on those platforms?</p>

<h6 id="2313">23:13</h6>
<p>Yeah, man What’s what’s kind of what’s crazy right now is this whole tick -tock thing? Honestly? I don’t even know what’s going on with tick -tock This is nuts, but again, it just shows you that like video content is is like what everybody is craving You know, it’s this weird platform where there’s dance videos and there’s all these things going on So like yeah, tick -tocks and something I haven’t even explored But it just kind of gives you a glimpse of the future because I feel like in some ways that is kind of like a future platform But yeah, Instagram you have stories, you know now it took that from Snapchat and just kind of made it cleaner and better Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean it just took it got rid of a lot of the junk on Facebook And now you have IGTV which is kind of like a competitor to YouTube in a lot of ways because it’s for the longer form content I think IGTV which is just you know longer videos for anybody who doesn’t know what that is on Instagram It kind of crashed and burned in the beginning.</p>

<h6 id="2410">24:10</h6>
<p>I didn’t really know what it was It was kind of like, you know this weird odd child that Instagram had and so it finally kind of found its place When people realized like oh, you know I want to be able to share something longer than one minute and then started being able to put that on IGTV and then put it in their feed Yeah, Instagram.</p>

<h6 id="2429">24:29</h6>
<p>Instagram has certain video caps, right? So they have like short, short storytelling or like, quick post that expired for 24 hours is going to be your story. Yeah, going to profile, you might get a little lengthier duration of video, which goes on your profile.</p>

<h6 id="2443">24:43</h6>
<p>And then anything beyond that needs to be an IGTV post. Yeah. So I mean, luckily now with IGTV, you can put it on IGTV. And then you can also have the option to be able to put it on your feed. So it’ll start automatically playing for people, like in their feed when they’re going through.</p>

<h6 id="2500">25:00</h6>
<p>And then once it gets to that one minute cap, then it’ll pause it and it’ll give you that option to continue on IGTV. So that’s kind of where IGTV is now is that it exists in it. It is very seamless and how it moves into your feed so that you can post that longer content.</p>

<h6 id="2516">25:16</h6>
<p>Like I do that for a client right now, you know, and sometimes they have content that’s 15, 20 minutes that we’re putting on YouTube. And then they also want to put it on Instagram so then it can live on IGTV, but then they can instantly, easily seamlessly bring it into their feed and make sure that people aren’t going to miss out on it there as well.</p>

<h6 id="2532">25:32</h6>
<p>Yes, stories. Stories is is an interesting thing. I think maybe for some brands, honestly, they’re going to get more engagement on stories, especially because this is the very top of the feed and it has this concept of 24 hour expiration.</p>

<h6 id="2545">25:45</h6>
<p>So you right as a follower, you want to absorb that content before it goes away and you don’t have a the what were they calling it FOMO fear of missing out. Yeah, yeah, fear of missing out. And yeah, you like I said, it’s at the top of your feed when there’s a new one, it’s kind of highlighted in the Instagram, you know, pallets.</p>

<h6 id="2603">26:03</h6>
<p>And so it’s like, oh, you know, it stands out. I find myself when I open Instagram, sometimes I just watch stories and then I close out Instagram and I realize like I never even looked through the feed, you know, exactly.</p>

<h6 id="2613">26:13</h6>
<p>So I think that’s just interesting user behavior that we have to pay attention to. Obviously, I think there’s other things that like Instagram stories has over any of the platform, because there’s there’s engaging tools like polls and questions and like reactions that you can’t get on other platforms that they’ve utilized and seen that like, okay, you can like a post, you can go and get the watch time.</p>

<h6 id="2636">26:36</h6>
<p>Or, you know, maybe a few comments on like a IG TV story. But if you want like, quick replies, like yes or no, you know, polling and questions, I think that’s just a it’s a huge, it’s a huge tool man other platforms.</p>

<h6 id="2651">26:51</h6>
<p>And what’s crazy too is like, so obviously there’s there’s ads and stories now, like, I think brands are being pretty clever with how they’re doing ads and stories. I’m not only even mine and maybe 75% of the ads that are in stories, as long as it’s like targeted toward me, like a lot of times those ads are pretty good, you know, and in like, the company or the brand has really thought through like how they want to share that.</p>

<h6 id="2713">27:13</h6>
<p>So I think that’s interesting for brands is like, if you’re going to run ads, and you’re going to run them in stories, like, make sure that it’s not disrupting the user, but it’s like adding to their experience.</p>

<h6 id="2722">27:22</h6>
<p>And again, it’s a good story. It’s a good presentation. because I have, you know, swiped up to go look and see, you know, what that, what that product or what that service is, because there was a compelling ad.</p>

<h6 id="2735">27:35</h6>
<p>So, you know, that’s really interesting to me is like ads and stories, you know, like it’s to me, it’s not that intrusive all the time, you know, and so it’s just an interesting way of how you can, you know, get yourself out there if you are a brand.</p>

<h6 id="2751">27:51</h6>
<p>But then yeah, if you’re just doing organic stories, like it’s it is crazy like one of the brands that we work for right now, the lady who has gotten up to a million followers. She really I think she she she worked so hard.</p>

<h6 id="2807">28:07</h6>
<p>So, so Ryan and Rose. A baby product company that worked for has awesome stuff. Great company and great people. She is, Lindsay has literally built her company in a lot of ways because of her Instagram stories and what she was doing on Instagram early on has one million followers and she just posts a ton every single day.</p>

<h6 id="2833">28:33</h6>
<p>And that’s all organic. Yeah, it’s all organic. You know, and she’s just doing it off of her iPhone. It’s not, it’s not off of some nice camera. It’s off of her iPhone. And again, it just comes down to that piece on consistency, like, you know, be in it for the long game, be in it for that daily consistent consistency.</p>

<h6 id="2849">28:49</h6>
<p>Like I struggle with it sometimes too. It’s like on a day you might be like, well, I’m just sitting on my desk doing, you know, edits. I don’t know what to post about. So I’m just not going to post anything.</p>

<h6 id="2900">29:00</h6>
<p>And so like, obviously, Lindsay has figured it out and luckily, you know, now she has a big enough brand in a, in a nice headquarters where she can walk around and show things off you know, but it’s in those early days where you’re like, what do I post?</p>

<h6 id="2912">29:12</h6>
<p>I don’t know. I don’t know what you need to post, but you just need to post. Yeah, if you ever wanted some inspiration or some motivation on, oh, I need to post more or do I have you question, you know, do I post too much too little?</p>

<h6 id="2923">29:23</h6>
<p>Just go check out Ryan and Rose stories. They are literally posting dozens of times a day. I mean, 30, 40, 50 posts in a day. It’s incredible to see. Yeah. I mean, luckily now she has a team, you know, who is doing awesome work all across social media, but yeah, I mean, like, if you don’t know what else to do, just, just talk to the camera, share things, you know, screenshot things, like just anything that’s like simple, but might be worthwhile and helpful for somebody else.</p>

<h6 id="2949">29:49</h6>
<p>Like you typically like when I typically sometimes get the best engagement when I just screenshot something and I’m just like, Hey, go check this out. This is really cool. I’m into this. I’m into this music or I’m doing this or that, you know, it’s not even the stuff that I’m like, I sat down and I like, uh, in Premiere Pro, I had a sequence that was set for portrait and then I made this awesome like video sequence.</p>

<h6 id="3010">30:10</h6>
<p>and put it in a story and I’m like, ah, you know, this is gonna get a lot of, this is gonna get a lot of engagement and views. Like sometimes yes, sometimes and a lot of times, not necessarily. It can be just the weird stuff that you just screenshot and you just share and like, hey, check this out.</p>

<h6 id="3026">30:26</h6>
<p>So just, yeah, just think simply, like you don’t have to go out and, you know, climb the tallest building and stick your legs out and take an awesome photo looking down, you know? I’m like, woo, like I’m this influencer.</p>

<h6 id="3037">30:37</h6>
<p>You should photoshop it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that’s your desk at Photoshop. Yeah. So like, just like think simpler, like what can you just share consistently? And again, like, I think it just comes down to just the fear of like sharing yourself, you know, and putting yourself out there.</p>

<h6 id="3057">30:57</h6>
<p>I think that’s the fear and I think that’s like, Somehow somehow Lindsay just conquered that she just conquered that fear of like I don’t care I’m gonna be on stories every day. I’m gonna say stuff I’m gonna share my life and the reality is is like when we share our lives on social media You’re obviously you’re gonna get criticism You’re gonna get people who are gonna hate on you But I think more than people hating on you you’re good people are gonna feel that connection to you into your brand So if you’re a brand listening and not an individual like people want to see behind the scenes BTS stands for behind the scenes people want to see behind the scenes So like just do as much behind the scenes content as you can and I promise like people are gonna eat it up It’s more personal, you know, it’s people Yeah, it’s yeah, yeah, it removes the curtain, you know, I think that’s the cool thing about stories Is like we can follow all these big -time influencers are these big -time stars like they’re doing stories in their home Are they’re doing stories in their car?</p>

<h6 id="3155">31:55</h6>
<p>You know, it literally has like pulled back the curtain to being like When we would see like a professional video, we’d be like, oh, I want to see from that angle Or I want to see this over in this corner and all of a sudden stories has allowed us this opportunity to see All of these different parts of like people that, you know, we would never see that Um, so I mean, I think that is so crucial is like what can you do to pull back the curtain on your brand?</p>

<h6 id="3218">32:18</h6>
<p>And reveal things to people and engage with people and interact and you’re right. It is going to be scary It’s going to feel awkward and weird For the first couple of weeks, maybe the first couple of months that you do it But building those connections is is what is going to bring more meaning and more value to your brand or even just yourself Right, great advice.</p>

<h6 id="3237">32:37</h6>
<p>I know you I know you mentioned, uh, you mentioned tiktok and brands and stuff. I mean tiktok My opinion on it. I think tiktok is interesting for for certain Uh, a certain group a certain demographic.</p>

<h6 id="3249">32:49</h6>
<p>I don’t know if tiktok sells. I think Could could have influencers that push brand recognition, but again, I’ve never bought anything because a TikTok person or an influencer tweeted it out. I just I never have, you know, typically I’ll go to Amazon, read reviews, do my own thorough research on it before I spend a decent amount of money on something that someone has said, Hey, this is a good product because I know that endorsement is solely paid for and has no real, no real value behind it.</p>

<h6 id="3318">33:18</h6>
<p>And so I think I think brand influencers in that space are interesting and how they’re approaching it and hats off to them for for blowing up and all these influencers making boo -coos of money to plug brands.</p>

<h6 id="3330">33:30</h6>
<p>But for me, for me, it’s it really comes down to if a brand came to me and says, what do I need to do? How do I tell a story? What platforms are going to be on? I think it really comes down to demographic, right?</p>

<h6 id="3341">33:41</h6>
<p>Right. Yeah. It’s like, where are your people hanging out? Where are the people that like for, you know, to go back to Ryan and Rose, like Lindsay knew that moms were hanging out on Instagram. So it just makes sense for her to pull over time and effort into Instagram.</p>

<h6 id="3354">33:54</h6>
<p>So, you know, if you know or can find out, if your people are hanging out on YouTube, Or, you know, obviously if you’re a photographer or videographer, you’re hanging out on YouTube. I hang out on YouTube all the time, you know?</p>

<h6 id="3404">34:04</h6>
<p>Tons of us follow influencers on YouTube. Um, obviously also on Instagram because it translates really well. Um, but yeah, I mean, if you’re marketing and, and doing stuff for an older demographic, they’re probably on Facebook, you know, older demographics, probably there.</p>

<h6 id="3419">34:19</h6>
<p>If you’re doing for kids, they’re probably on TikTok or Instagram. Um, so I think it’s just understanding where are the, where are the people that you’re trying to reach? Where are they hanging? Where are they hanging out?</p>

<h6 id="3427">34:27</h6>
<p>And that’s where you need to hang out as well. And it doesn’t mean that you need to be all things to all people. Um, and be on Facebook and be on Instagram and be on TikTok and be on, because, because there might be one person on TikTok, you know, that could purchase.</p>

<h6 id="3438">34:38</h6>
<p>Like, no, don’t go down that, that rabbit hole. Just like find where the majority of the people are and hang out on that network and own it. And then if you want to consider going to other platforms, then do it, do it later, but just focus on one platform where the majority of the people are.</p>

<h6 id="3452">34:52</h6>
<p>Yeah. And a very similar model that I’ve seen time and time again work is, is people that want to sell stuff that are very crafty. Um, typically they don’t just start a website like a Shopify or a, or a Squarespace site and start selling stuff.</p>

<h6 id="3504">35:04</h6>
<p>And they’re not typically successful unless they already have like a huge following. A lot of times they’ll, they’ll start on Instagram just to start doing their advertising and building like brand loyalty and getting the messaging out there.</p>

<h6 id="3515">35:15</h6>
<p>Uh, and then they’ll also throw everything on Etsy because that’s where people are. And you know, you’re not going to ABC, uh, you know, baby, baby bottles .com, you know, to search for the latest and greatest baby bottle.</p>

<h6 id="3528">35:28</h6>
<p>You’re going to like Amazon, you’re going to Etsy, if you want something handmade, Right. At that point, you, you know, you, you have a platform to read reviews and customers like that. Cause they get, get a sense of, they get a sense of security that they know they’re getting a good product versus going to, you know, XYZ, baby bottles .com or whatever.</p>

<h6 id="3546">35:46</h6>
<p>Yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. For sure. I think niche market, um, is so big and so crucial right now. Like I was just talking to my wife about it the other day. It’s, it’s crazy. Like I think we’ve had these massive jumps in history.</p>

<h6 id="3558">35:58</h6>
<p>Obviously. you know, like with the invention of the car and then the invention of the internet, like we’re just going through like a massive time right now where you can literally do anything and be anybody online.</p>

<h6 id="3609">36:09</h6>
<p>So I mean, like my wife just ordered literally like, like fondant stuff to go on a cake for my for my two year old’s birthday party. So like somebody who just crafts like little things that’ll go on on cake, like bought that off of Etsy, like it’s just you can be the most niche specialty thing and still have a market based on whatever you’re good at.</p>

<h6 id="3630">36:30</h6>
<p>So like, you know, it just it just comes down to like whatever you’re passionate about, passionate about whatever you’re good about, if you’re already within a brand or something like that, like what what you’re really good at doing.</p>

<h6 id="3641">36:41</h6>
<p>So if you’re somebody who’s like, you know, who can share a story or can show behind the scenes, you know, just trying to relate this back to video content, like if you’re somebody like that on your team who’s like has a knack for that, and you guys aren’t already doing that.</p>

<h6 id="3656">36:56</h6>
<p>then I would highly recommend that you propose that and you be the one who leads the charge on that because I just see so many companies and so many brands who are like, well, we gotta be on social media, so we gotta be out there.</p>

<h6 id="3707">37:07</h6>
<p>What does that mean? It’s just to be on there. And if you go to some of their profiles, it’s terrible. I’d rather for you not to be on here. Yeah, it’s full of stock photography with a caption that says, what do you think?</p>

<h6 id="3721">37:21</h6>
<p>I mean, you have to be, I don’t wanna be so superficial and your feed has to be completely tailored, but there is something to be said for like, when you go to somebody’s feed, you know what you’re gonna get.</p>

<h6 id="3734">37:34</h6>
<p>So I think that’s- I think that’s tried and true. If you look at any brand online that’s regardless of which social platform they’re on, if they have a sense of personality that resonates, then people wanna follow it regardless of if it’s- Oh, for sure.</p>

<h6 id="3745">37:45</h6>
<p>If it’s because they love the product or it’s because it’s entertaining. Yeah, I think that’s a great word, personality. Inject your personality. Don’t try and be somebody else. Don’t try and be another influencer.</p>

<h6 id="3755">37:55</h6>
<p>Like do what comes naturally to you and let that personality shine. Because at the end of the day, what’s gonna be easiest is for you to be yourself and to be your personality and who you are. And then just throw that out there for the world to have and not try and steal from somebody else’s personality because it’s gonna be fake.</p>

<h6 id="3812">38:12</h6>
<p>It’s not gonna be true to you or true to your brand. Yeah. That’s awesome. So I wanna touch a little bit on accessibility if we have time and then in this segment with some rapid fire questions just to have some fun and of course I wanted to allow you to have time to plug your stuff and for people to be able to figure out where to find you online.</p>

<h6 id="3832">38:32</h6>
<p>Because I think you constantly post good material regardless if it’s blogging or checking out your video work just to get inspired about how you shoot stuff and how you edit things and you have your own style to it.</p>

<h6 id="3847">38:47</h6>
<p>So we’ll just end this. I’ll just plug here, not for myself, but I’ll just say like I’ll just be honest. Like I struggle with posting just as much as everybody else. else does like I have days where I just am just creating so much for other people that I just am so sapped Creatively that I just don’t post and I can even go like a week without posting But I have to remind myself like no just put something out there Just share just share for the heck of sharing like really I’m trying to just take the perspective on like Instagram or whether it’s YouTube Like just share because you enjoy it just share because it’s fun You know, I think it’s very obvious the feet the people that are it feels forced to share because it doesn’t come across as like organic Again, like I get the best response when I just share something just because it’s out of the heart of like I just want to have fun.</p>

<h6 id="3931">39:31</h6>
<p>I just want to enjoy this or I just want to you know Share communally with with everybody who follows me just like what I’m experiencing like there’s just so much more joy out of that Rather than just forcing the issue That’s great advice.</p>

<h6 id="3943">39:43</h6>
<p>So a few things I want to touch on, I think it’s very important. We’ll see a huge demand for it in 2020. I think Google will probably reward this action if people take note on it. And that comes down to accessibility.</p>

<h6 id="3959">39:59</h6>
<p>I think that building brands and having these beautiful platforms to share stuff and telling stories is great. But how important do you feel accessibility is through video? And how do we utilize that?</p>

<h6 id="4012">40:12</h6>
<p>Yeah, accessibility through video. Man, like I said before, it is a great frontier in the fact that it’s cheaper than ever to be able to produce. And I just try and keep bringing that back home, is that you can do this without having to invest a lot.</p>

<h6 id="4029">40:29</h6>
<p>Like we said earlier, what you have in your pocket is probably a smartphone. And you can do great things with that. I totally believe that traditional media, as far as what’s on your TV and that kind of advertising, is definitely starting to go away.</p>

<h6 id="4047">40:47</h6>
<p>Like you have Netflix and Hulu and all these different other avenues where people are creating content just for those platforms. And so it’s moving in more of this direction of pay to play platforms.</p>

<h6 id="4100">41:00</h6>
<p>The great thing about YouTube is that you don’t have to necessarily pay, but you’re paying with your time to watch advertisements on there. I mean, you can pay YouTube and not have to watch ads. I mean, that’s part of their program as well.</p>

<h6 id="4113">41:13</h6>
<p>But yeah, I just think like I think again, it just comes down to relationship and relational. I love to watch people on YouTube or follow people on Instagram just because I like to see what’s going on.</p>

<h6 id="4124">41:24</h6>
<p>You know, I kind of feel like I’m relating to them. Like I’m the content on YouTube that I love the most. Again, it’s like a lot of times a mixture of maybe they’re teaching me something or training me on something, but they’re showing me behind the scene stuff, you know, so the stuff that’s just like most relatable.</p>

<h6 id="4141">41:41</h6>
<p>Is this stuff that I like and you just don’t find that on traditional TV really, you know You just don’t find this behind the scenes organic kind of feeling content right because it doesn’t like a Traditional brands like TV shows they don’t really focus on value.</p>

<h6 id="4154">41:54</h6>
<p>It’s more of entertainment. Right. Yeah Yeah, and like that’s the cool thing is like on YouTube you get a mixture of you know in one video You can learn something you can be entertained and you can feel like you’re connecting with somebody Which is I don’t know it’s just it’s a crazy mix of Value a crazy mix of just Things that are going on and again like that really only comes through video It doesn’t come through photos like you can look at a photo and admire it and be like oh, that’s cool It’s awesome, but like what does a video do way beyond that a 15 minute YouTube video Showing behind the scenes teaching you something, you know all these different things like that does so much more than a photo And yes, it takes that much more to make it and actually create it But video connects in such a greater way than even a photo does, you know I take photos a lot of times and share photos because it’s like a quick way for me to just shoot something out there and it’s fun and I enjoy photography, but video takes video takes a lot more work, you know, and that’s why a lot of people kind of shy away from it is because video, it’s it is hard.</p>

<h6 id="4254">42:54</h6>
<p>You can get a $20 ,000 red camera, but if you don’t know what the heck you’re doing with that $20 ,000 camera, you’re going to make the same crap that somebody’s going to make on a $600 Canon, you know, or on their iPhone.</p>

<h6 id="4306">43:06</h6>
<p>So it just comes down to like, you have to understand storytelling, you have to understand beginning, middle and end. You don’t have to be a journalism major, but you just have to understand how to tell a story.</p>

<h6 id="4314">43:14</h6>
<p>You need to understand composition when it comes to videography. And like, you can totally learn that again, it’s not super complex, you just have to understand some of that. And then you just have to understand like good editing, you know, and that’s something that I wanted to talk about, but we don’t have a whole lot of time for that left.</p>

<h6 id="4330">43:30</h6>
<p>But good editing is really I love this analogy. Good editing is like the difference between like a Kia and a Bugatti, because like a Kia gets the job done, it gets you from like A to B, but a Bugatti gets you from A to B with a lot of flash, you know, you’re a baller.</p>

<h6 id="4347">43:47</h6>
<p>If you’re driving that, he’s got that great malls per gallon, you know, I know, I know, right, you know, but you can go and pick one up for like $15 ,000, you know, so it’s no big deal. So like, like editing does have a lot to do with it, it doesn’t, it doesn’t have all to do with it.</p>

<h6 id="4403">44:03</h6>
<p>But like, you can see like the same shots, like arranged in a certain way, you know, and it’d be like that’s kind of amateur. And then you can see that the same shots arranged in a different way and maybe using different music or using sound effects.</p>

<h6 id="4417">44:17</h6>
<p>And the editing, the editing does matter at the end of the day. So it’s just, it’s just really interesting that there are so many components of video that make a really good video. And again, that’s why it is hard.</p>

<h6 id="4432">44:32</h6>
<p>That’s why I love this industry. That’s why I love the art of creating videos is because like, there’s so much more to it than somebody to say, Hey, just throw up a can. camera and let’s just capture it.</p>

<h6 id="4442">44:42</h6>
<p>Like there’s a time and place for that. But at the same time, I love it because like people just don’t understand the full extent of like what I do. And I love being able to do all aspects of that. I love being able to charge for that.</p>

<h6 id="4455">44:55</h6>
<p>But I love being able to do all aspects of that because there’s just so, there’s so many different pieces there that I enjoy telling a story, great visuals, driving music, you know, like creating emotion, feeling that emotion, connecting, I don’t know, all that stuff together just like just totally gets me.</p>

<h6 id="4516">45:16</h6>
<p>Yeah, I’m just so passionate about it because there’s so many pieces. Like you just don’t get that in a photo. You don’t get that in a blog post. You only get that. I think it’s so fascinating about your industry and people that are interested in getting a video is like the web of the last eight or 10 years has become very templated.</p>

<h6 id="4534">45:34</h6>
<p>And, you know, it’s a major part. It’s the number one, you know, one number one resource for people finding people online as websites. And those solutions have become so templated and streamlined so that they become quote unquote, affordable.</p>

<h6 id="4547">45:47</h6>
<p>But you can’t necessarily pull that off of the video. I mean, I could argue against templated websites aren’t a good solution either for most brands because it just looks cheap. But in general, you can’t get that with video because it doesn’t resonate.</p>

<h6 id="4601">46:01</h6>
<p>It isn’t really. It doesn’t hit the heartbeat of your user and your clientele. Yeah, I mean, video video can distinguish a brand based on the style of the video. And you know, you know, whose video it is based on just like the shots that they get, the story that they’re telling and the way that they edit it.</p>

<h6 id="4620">46:20</h6>
<p>Again, it does come down to style. Again, it comes down to the key and the Bugatti, you know, one’s got style and one maybe has some style. But, you know, it just there’s there’s a difference there that you can visually see and you just know like that’s yeah, that’s a that’s a decent thing.</p>

<h6 id="4636">46:36</h6>
<p>And then that’s like, yeah, that one over there like, wow, wow, you stop and you admire it. You know, that’s cyber truck. Yeah. Yeah. No, I’m not admiring cyber truck. Too far. I think I think trend this has been super valuable.</p>

<h6 id="4653">46:53</h6>
<p>I think a lot of our users are going to resonate with a lot that you’ve been saying and hopefully hopefully find find value in and some inspiration to hope so video into their to the marketing, how they how they tell stories and and capture that audience and and you know, thanks for coming on.</p>

<h6 id="4710">47:10</h6>
<p>I want to end this. I want to send with a segment, which is just rapid fire questions. Just have a little fun. And so you ready to get into that? Let’s do it. Let’s do it. Rapid fire. Yeah. So just try to keep it super short and sweet so we can fly through these.</p>

<h6 id="4723">47:23</h6>
<p>Cool. So what is your favorite social media platform and why? Definitely Instagram, like I said, photo video. It just cuts a lot of the clutter of Facebook and other things, but you can share so much on and you have stories, you have your feed, and you have all these different people and influencers and stuff like that.</p>

<h6 id="4738">47:38</h6>
<p>And you can just, you can follow anybody and everybody and create whatever you want and post it there. Cool. What is the best smartphone app for photography and video editing? So I don’t, I used to do some video editing, but I don’t really, just being a pro and a creative, like doing video, like I just want to do complex things with video, so that just requires a computer.</p>

<h6 id="4755">47:55</h6>
<p>But for photography, definitely download the Lightroom app by Adobe. And that’s gonna give you way more creative control over your photos. And you can download presets if that’s where you want to start at, but you can just fine tune a ton of things.</p>

<h6 id="4809">48:09</h6>
<p>And it’s free. There are some parts of it that’s not free, but it’s free, so go download the Lightroom app. Okay, another one here. YouTube or Vimeo, should brands really care? Yes, I would put my videos on YouTube because they’re gonna be seen by more people.</p>

<h6 id="4824">48:24</h6>
<p>And also YouTube is free, you’re gonna have to pay for Vimeo. Vimeo is really just for more kind of portfolio stuff. YouTube is really to get in front of an audience. So I would 100% do YouTube. OK, cool.</p>

<h6 id="4834">48:34</h6>
<p>We got first impressions of the Cybertruck. I don’t like it. I don’t. I think Tesla’s I think the Tesla cars look sweet. I know some people don’t like the Tesla vehicles. I like them. The Cybertruck to me looks terrible.</p>

<h6 id="4847">48:47</h6>
<p>That’s just my. And yeah, yeah, it does. It looks like they just they just were in a shop somewhere just banging together some metal and just threw it on top of like a F -150. So yeah, cool. So I know you dabble a lot with drones.</p>

<h6 id="4859">48:59</h6>
<p>That’s a huge part of your tool belt. What’s your kind of go to drone shot? Um, this is one that I call kind of the up and out. So I like to kind of like pull like when I’m ending something, especially if I’m like ending it like a narrative of like a city or a place I like to kind of yeah, I like to pull back with the drone and just kind of move up and move out.</p>

<h6 id="4918">49:18</h6>
<p>And so that kind of just gives us good kind of last shot of like where we were and then just kind of fade to black. Awesome. And plus I think it just gives it gives a good ending point. And then like it shows you the big picture versus all these really close up shots with this is a beautiful and storytelling.</p>

<h6 id="4935">49:35</h6>
<p>Right. Again, you know, I would tell people book in stuff with establishing shots. So like when you’re getting started with a video, like establish the scene where it’s at and then at the end of it, I would do the same thing as well.</p>

<h6 id="4946">49:46</h6>
<p>Book and it’s a good word. Uh, OK, cool. So what is a book that’s changed your life? Oh, man, I was thinking about this one like all day today. This is so hard because like I I do read a lot. And I love that like books are so focused on certain topics.</p>

<h6 id="5001">50:01</h6>
<p>One second, one second. We may have to come back to this one. OK, look, I got a curveball here. Who’s your favorite YouTuber? My favorite YouTuber is still Peter McKinnon. Thanks for being more photography video based.</p>

<h6 id="5014">50:14</h6>
<p>Yeah, photography video based. He does have some BTS stuff that is fun. But really, if you’re like if you’re interested in photo video and you want to get inspired, but you also want to go learn some stuff, definitely go follow Peter, Peter McKinnon.</p>

<h6 id="5028">50:28</h6>
<p>He will teach you. He’s been YouTubing for three years now, I think, and he’s got like four million. million subscribers. It’s it’s wild. It’s awesome. So I got to two more of this besides the book question.</p>

<h6 id="5039">50:39</h6>
<p>What’s what’s the best piece of advice that you’ve ever received? Oh, best piece. Yeah, like I said earlier is just just create just create for the sake of it. Just make you know, just yeah, just do just make whatever it is.</p>

<h6 id="5052">50:52</h6>
<p>Make make make make. Don’t worry so much about like, what people are going to think and like where you’re going to put it but just create something because you have an idea. Just create because I have an idea and because you enjoy creating.</p>

<h6 id="5103">51:03</h6>
<p>Charlotte buff man. Just do it. Just do it. Just do it. You figure out that favorite book. Favorite book. Okay, this is one that I’ve read within the last two years. It’s probably not my favorite because that’s just hard.</p>

<h6 id="5116">51:16</h6>
<p>But this is one that I really, really enjoy. It’s called thirst and it’s it’s by an organization called charity water. This is kind of different avenue than business and Actually, it does relate to photo, but it’s by Scott Harrison the guy who started an organization called charity water and basically what they’re doing It’s trying to bring clean water to All people around the world, but I love his book because it’s super insightful for multiple things one He has a crazy wild story.</p>

<h6 id="5144">51:44</h6>
<p>I won’t I won’t ruin it. So go read it. He’s a crazy wild story And he also is a Christian so I’m a Christian. So like that’s really important to me And then also whenever he had this major turning point in his life when he did become a Christian He went and did work in Africa and started doing photography to be able to tell stories for an organization called Mercy ships So they go in do they go and do Surgeries for for kids in Africa who just have the craziest things going on and he realized that he could do a lot of photography In order to tell those stories and to be able to get more funding back in the States to make more surgeries happen So then that led him the idea to to be able to document things really really well to share and tell stories To get people who have a lot of money to be able to back things that would be really good for the world So then he started this organization called charity water to bring clean water to people all around the world And he does it does a great job at it because he does photography and great video and tells amazing stories And so I love it because he’s so keen and so focused on telling great stories And so like to me that’s that’s a huge thing I love how he’s built a brand and built an organization around being so focused on good storytelling That’s awesome.</p>

<h5 id="ken-blasko--eli-brumley-discuss-conquering-remote-work-as-a-lead-ux-designer-and-full-stack-software-engineer">Ken Blasko &amp; Eli Brumley discuss Conquering Remote Work as a Lead UX Designer and Full Stack Software Engineer.</h5>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of the tech industry, the concept of remote work has taken center stage, especially with recent global shifts like the COVID-19 pandemic. In an engaging episode of the PlaidPixel Podcast, hosts Ken Blasko, a Lead UX Designer, and Eli Brumley, a Full Stack Software Engineer, dive deep into the world of remote work. They share their personal experiences and insights, painting a vivid picture of the remote work lifestyle, its challenges, and its rewards.</p>

<p>Ken’s journey into remote work began as a necessity following a move driven by his fiancee’s job change, while Eli transitioned into this mode more recently, about nine months ago. Both hosts highlight the critical elements that make remote working successful: the ability to adapt, effective communication, and a high degree of self-motivation. They emphasize the importance of creating a conducive work environment at home, noting that investments in quality equipment, like ergonomic chairs and standing desks, pay dividends in comfort and productivity. The conversation also touches on the benefits employers and employees enjoy with remote work, such as reduced company overheads and improved work-life balance for employees.</p>

<p>However, it’s not all smooth sailing. Ken and Eli candidly discuss the challenges of remote work, such as the potential for feeling isolated due to the lack of face-to-face interactions with colleagues and the need for strong self-discipline to stay productive. Despite these challenges, they agree that the flexibility and time saved from commuting make remote work an attractive option. From personal anecdotes to practical tips, Ken and Eli’s discussion is a treasure trove of information for anyone curious about or currently navigating the remote work landscape in the tech world. Their insights underscore a vital message: with the right approach, remote work can not only be feasible but also immensely fulfilling.</p>

<h6 id="0000">00:00</h6>
<p>You’re listening to the Plaid Pixel podcast with your host, Eli Brumley and Ken Blasco. Let’s enter the world of web design, development and so much more. Hey all, welcome back to the Plaid Pixel podcast.</p>

<h6 id="0022">00:22</h6>
<p>I’m your host Ken Blasco and with me always is Eli Brumley. Hey Eli. Hey Ken. Hello man. It’s going really well. I’m so excited about this topic that we’re going to touch on today. And not only is it something that’s trending in the news because of the craziness of this COVID -19 coronavirus, but I think it’s, you and I are both remote workers.</p>

<h6 id="0046">00:46</h6>
<p>And we chose that lifestyle for the pros and cons of it. And I think I’m just so excited to talk with you on this topic and figure out what you struggle with and what you value of remote work. And in those listening, we have a ton of stuff we’re going to dive into and we’re going to have links in the show notes and all this stuff on resources and things to leverage.</p>

<h6 id="0109">01:09</h6>
<p>If remote work is something that you have to do based on a health reason or if it’s a lifestyle choice, which is awesome. And let’s get into it. So Ken, how long have you been working remote? Yeah, so let’s see.</p>

<h6 id="0127">01:27</h6>
<p>It’s been almost about two and a half years roughly. So I think it started 2018 and right now it’s a little 2020. I think I started at the beginning of 2018. So the job I had at the time, I worked on site.</p>

<h6 id="0143">01:43</h6>
<p>Primarily the entire time I worked there. I found out that my fiance, well, my girlfriend at the time, fiance now, she got a new job. Congratulations. Thank you. So we decided to move mostly because of her work and we kind of wanted to change.</p>

<h6 id="0158">01:58</h6>
<p>And we wanted to get back out west. Our family is all out here. So anyway, my boss at the time said, hey, I’m moving. Luckily, he saw that I provided a lot of value and said, yeah, you can go ahead and work remotely for us.</p>

<h6 id="0210">02:10</h6>
<p>It’s totally fine. So that was kind of my first gig, remote. Yeah, I mean, it’s been awesome, man. Like that first time coming out remote, it was a huge change, you know, totally different. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.</p>

<h6 id="0223">02:23</h6>
<p>Like flexibility is awesome. I mean, we’ll obviously get into all that, the pros and the cons. So yeah, it’s been awesome. That sounds awesome. So it seems like that was something you’ve always wanted to do.</p>

<h6 id="0236">02:36</h6>
<p>And now you’ve been doing it for a little over two years and it seems like it’s working out for you. No, so it’s funny because I’ve always thought I’ve wanted to like travel and work remotely. And sure, I mean, now I’m working remotely, but not so much traveling.</p>

<h6 id="0252">02:52</h6>
<p>But either way, point being is working from home has been so awesome. Yeah. So I’ve got a similar story. I mean, I didn’t do as much, you know, moving across the country. I knew taking the leap of faith and going the remote route was definitely something that I struggle with.</p>

<h6 id="0315">03:15</h6>
<p>But through just some of these tips and stuff that I’ve picked up on and talking to the people that are remote, it’s been a lifestyle change for the better. And I’ve been doing it for eight, nine months now.</p>

<h6 id="0329">03:29</h6>
<p>And, you know, I’ve always, I’ve always kind of worked, quote unquote, remote during the weekends, because I serve clients, you know, part time for, you know, applied pixel and Sure. Helping them with their company values, but, but online needs.</p>

<h6 id="0344">03:44</h6>
<p>But really, it’s, for me, it was, it was a struggle. And I wanted to talk a little bit about the things that I came in contact with and and help me through through the diversities of remote work and some of the things that I think people would would find useful, you know, right, right.</p>

<h6 id="0403">04:03</h6>
<p>So I think the biggest thing that we had a few topics we’ll touch on here. I think the biggest thing we could we could definitely kick off is, you know, where do you start with remote work? And I guess the first part of that is, do you are you in a technology space that allows you to do that?</p>

<h6 id="0416">04:16</h6>
<p>Or, you know, a career space allows you to work remote for one. And if so, where do you go to find a job? Yeah, I mean, luckily for us, you know, we’re in the software industry and that kind of blends very well to working remotely.</p>

<h6 id="0432">04:32</h6>
<p>You know, if you have an internet connection, you can pretty much, you know, work wherever. But yeah, getting into remote work, I mean, you know, there’s definitely different websites out there that you can go to that, you know, have, you know, all remote job listings.</p>

<h6 id="0447">04:47</h6>
<p>Yeah, I’ve noticed a lot more job listings, even though it’s not necessarily like all the ones that are specifically like remote work .com or, you know, whatever they are, and we’ll link all those in the show notes below.</p>

<h6 id="0459">04:59</h6>
<p>But I’m noticed a lot of, a lot of like traditional job listing sites, like Monster and all those, they now offer like a pretty hefty, like remote option whenever you’re filtering for a career. Yeah, I feel like they’re kind of, they’re getting on that wave now.</p>

<h6 id="0514">05:14</h6>
<p>And they’re starting to see a lot more people searching for those things. Yeah. Nice. I didn’t know that they, uh, I haven’t been to the sites in forever. So that’s, that’s good to hear. Um, yeah, I know there’s like a few sites out there.</p>

<h6 id="0525">05:25</h6>
<p>There’s remote okay .io. There’s remote .io. There’s so many. And yeah, like Eli said, we’re going to link all these in the show notes. Um, I think one of the other important things about getting a remote job, if you’re looking to get into that space is just networking and no people.</p>

<h6 id="0542">05:42</h6>
<p>Um, sure. I mean, after I moved out here, I ended up getting a different job working remotely. Um, for a company that was actually still in Memphis, but only mostly because I knew a guy there from working at another job in Memphis.</p>

<h6 id="0556">05:56</h6>
<p>So, you know, it’s all, it’s all crazy, but. Point is you know networking goes a long way and just another piece of that puzzle is if you know somebody and if they have Opportunities available where you can work remotely Then that that’s a potential in in the drawer as well.</p>

<h6 id="0610">06:10</h6>
<p>Yeah, so when I want to start to consider going remote if you typically Have a history of working an in -person job, which most of us have an in -office job It’s it’s a huge leap of faith for for not just the employee And to change that lifestyle but for for the employer and the company you’re working for because there’s there’s a huge level of responsibility and being able to kind of let go of some of this initial control and and I think it takes a special personality and a certain skill set for For being able to work remote and some of the things that I picked up on as far as if you’re looking for a job and your question Like is this right for me?</p>

<h6 id="0649">06:49</h6>
<p>And the biggest thing is is do you kind of over do you over communicate do you communicate clearly on a frequent basis and You know is are you kind of a self -starter? Are you someone that takes initiative on task?</p>

<h6 id="0703">07:03</h6>
<p>It doesn’t have to be kind of necessarily quote -unquote micromanaged to get through the day and And most of these technology jobs, you know, they harness they harness technology as well So they have they have you know go -to meeting and and Google Hangouts and zoom and you know We have Slack which is kind of an all -encompassing tool.</p>

<h6 id="0722">07:22</h6>
<p>What there’s also like Microsoft teams and And so not only being able to be kind of a self starter and over communicate But but as well as leverage and and know the ins and outs of these pieces of software So there’s no real learning curve and your productivity Hopefully hopefully goes up and you know, that’s that’s one of the reasons why employers look for remote work is One is typically cheaper you can hire you can hire outside of your zip code But when they look for that character trait the personality for someone to fill that role, they’re really looking to some looking for someone that can take initiative over communicate and has a decent amount of technology understanding because there’s a ton of technology that you have to leverage when you go remote.</p>

<h6 id="0811">08:11</h6>
<p>So, Kendi, do you want to touch on some of the things that we use and would be helpful? Yeah, I mean, I think you definitely mentioned a few of them, you know, as far as software goes, but, you know, leveraging the proper technology in general, right?</p>

<h6 id="0824">08:24</h6>
<p>I think it’s, you know, very important that you kind of invest into whatever space that you’re in, whether that’s like your office, but especially like the internet, like your internet connection, you may want to have a wired connection instead of wireless.</p>

<h6 id="0837">08:37</h6>
<p>Yeah, you definitely get what you pay for when it comes to internet. Yeah, no, exactly. Almost anything, right? Like even a desk, like maybe you want to invest in a nice standing desk. I know I have one, Eli, I know you have one.</p>

<h6 id="0851">08:51</h6>
<p>You know, same with a great chair, you know, it’s funny because I have a Herman Miller chair. My fiance gave me so much crap about spending all this money on a nice office chair. They’re not cheap But I would I would buy it all over again.</p>

<h6 id="0908">09:08</h6>
<p>I would do the same thing. I have no regrets. I used to have back problems. I Have no issues anymore. This chair is fantastic Yeah, so kind of investing not only in in your in yourself as far as technology goes but investing into supplies Typically those supplies of a good quality will will not only last you longer But but as you mentioned, we’ll also give back to your health, you know, yeah Exactly, yeah, it’s easy to you know, let that go Sometimes very very important to recognize that hey, you need to take care of yourself Yeah, there’s so many things like when you’re working in an office space whether it’s you know, very corporate or more of a relaxed You know business casual environment.</p>

<h6 id="0951">09:51</h6>
<p>There’s so many things that that that company provides for you And I think more and more companies will start to see the benefits of remote work but also will start to see the amount of money that they save and You know and part of that is the the brick and mortar and and the the Wi -Fi costs utility snacks All these things that that companies have to have to have as far as overhead goes to keep their employees, you know happy and and kind of motivated in office space And and you know for those companies that are brave enough to take their company their employees and their brand remote It’s a it’s a bold move.</p>

<h6 id="1027">10:27</h6>
<p>It’s a it’s a it’s a yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a crazy It’s a crazy step and I think in the right direction and part of that is not only investing back into your people But investing into the technology.</p>

<h6 id="1039">10:39</h6>
<p>So I’m hoping we’ll see more companies step in and say hey You know, if you want to work remote we have these things But then give them some kind of kind of home and in home budget Whether it’s quarterly or yearly to kind of invest into Equipment or you know, maybe an extra monitor or you know, thank you things that we just, we take for granted like dongles, if you have an updated MacBook Pro or adapters or even if it’s something is like coffee, things like that are just so, we take advantage of if you’re in the office, that you kind of take for granted.</p>

<h6 id="1115">11:15</h6>
<p>And so it’s, I’m hoping we’ll see more of a push for that and employers and brands will see the value in investing that. Even if it’s just little things, it’s the things that build culture between you and your company you work for.</p>

<h6 id="1129">11:29</h6>
<p>Right, well, I think that’s one of the biggest things is you have to find a way to stay engaged, keep your remote employees engaged. And yeah, if that, and I think a lot of companies will let you like expend certain things that you need, Rob would hope so, right?</p>

<h6 id="1147">11:47</h6>
<p>Or if you’re doing your own business, there’s like tax write offs you can get on certain things. No, I totally agree, Ken. You mentioned a minute ago about your health and investing back into, you know, feeling better with the chair.</p>

<h6 id="1200">12:00</h6>
<p>One thing that you and I both invested in last year was a really high quality standing desk. Yeah. And that has made a world of a difference as far as, you know, motivation and posture and, and I know it’s not, you know, you’re not burning a significant amount of calories from sitting to standing, but just, you know, the posture and being able to kind of have a, have an option to, to adjust your desk at different levels and we’ll link a few, actually link the ones that Ken and I have down below.</p>

<h6 id="1230">12:30</h6>
<p>We really like the products and give them a free plug. But I know if you want to go to cheaper out, Ikea also has some, some standing desks that are, that are manual and they might even have some that have the motors that are more like kind of traditional hand crank.</p>

<h6 id="1244">12:44</h6>
<p>But, but there’s, there’s options out there if you want to go, if you want to go cheap in that route. Yeah, yeah, there’s definitely affordable options. Yeah, I still think like great chair, you know, if you need a mat for the standing desk, even, even good equipment, right?</p>

<h6 id="1300">13:00</h6>
<p>If you like a good monitor, you know, keyboard, mouse, whatever, whatever you like, make sure you, you know, keep your office space the way you like it, keep it clean. And I think we’re going to dive a little bit more into that with the, with the pros and the cons.</p>

<h6 id="1314">13:14</h6>
<p>So I think the biggest one for me, especially as well, you don’t really have to drive into where you’re not stuck in traffic. Well, for sure. You’re saving time, saving money. Yeah, imagine the amount of wear and tear that you put on your vehicle, gasoline, you know, ongoing manage for a car or having to invest into a, a reliable vehicle to get you somewhere.</p>

<h6 id="1337">13:37</h6>
<p>I mean, that’s, that’s a car note by itself. If you, if you don’t have the funds to buy a car, right? Which most people, you know, typically finance. So I mean, that’s, that’s just that cost alone is, is, is a huge, huge saver is money and time.</p>

<h6 id="1352">13:52</h6>
<p>Right. And if you’re a car owner, you know, you’re not going to be able to go to a car service, you know, If you live in an area where you can walk to places, you may not even need to own a car. So there’s always that.</p>

<h6 id="1401">14:01</h6>
<p>Yeah, so I think that’s a good point. Whenever we talk about remote, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you work from home, right? Exactly, right? Yeah, that kind of gets into one of the other pros, right?</p>

<h6 id="1412">14:12</h6>
<p>You can essentially work anywhere you want with an internet connection. You could totally be a digital nomad. You could go from coffee shop to coffee shop. Like I knew a guy who would do that and he would just travel to different cities, just shack up in an Airbnb.</p>

<h6 id="1426">14:26</h6>
<p>Like you’d do that for months at a time. Sure, I actually don’t even know where he lived. So I don’t know if you’re a nomad like that. I don’t know if you can say you live somewhere or for you just visit, you know?</p>

<h6 id="1440">14:40</h6>
<p>Right, but I think that’s the other, you know, one of the other coolest parts. You can essentially, you kind of have flexibility to, work from anywhere essentially with an internet connection. And it kind of also like if you need to take some time to go, you know, do something somewhere else, you can still work from there and still do whatever you need to do.</p>

<h6 id="1503">15:03</h6>
<p>Sure. You know, whether it’s visiting family or whatever, right? Yeah, I think that’s a huge point. If it’s, you know, if you have a limited amount of PTO or you really value the PTO that your company gives you, you know, having a quote unquote remote job allows you to, as long as you work it out with your employer and your company, it allows you to do a little bit of traveling with occasional freedom.</p>

<h6 id="1528">15:28</h6>
<p>And, you know, say you did a full week vacation, right? So in a traditional setting, you’re going to burn 40 hours of PTO, which is a ton of time that a lot of people have to accrue or given. And, you know, in America, it’s typically you have two, maybe even three weeks of PTO.</p>

<h6 id="1546">15:46</h6>
<p>Some tech companies are investing into more, which is great. But typically you have two or three weeks if you’ve built up a lot of time. And at that point, you know, if you say you’re traveling, you know, whether it’s a planted car, you can go to that place as long as they have a reliable connection and work it out with your manager to work certain hours.</p>

<h6 id="1606">16:06</h6>
<p>You know, maybe you don’t burn a whole 40 hours, but you get up and you want to work like six to 11 or six to noon. And then you have the rest of your day on that on that PTO schedule and you’re not having to burn a full 40 hours just to go visit family or something from out of town.</p>

<h6 id="1621">16:21</h6>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. I visited a buddy of mine in Philadelphia and I took one day off and I worked the other two days because I think he had to work and yeah, it’s just cool because, you know, you can do that kind of thing.</p>

<h6 id="1633">16:33</h6>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I know you mentioned saving time. I think something that we don’t think of on the employer, the employer level. The employer is also benefiting quite a bit as far as your time management goes because you’re very, you’re very likely to be late for work, right?</p>

<h6 id="1649">16:49</h6>
<p>I mean, you, you know. If you have a home office and you’re within a minute or two after you grab a cup of coffee to be in the office, you know, and having an excuse of like, oh, I got stopped by a train or traffic or whatever, you know, things like that.</p>

<h6 id="1705">17:05</h6>
<p>You don’t have to worry about those things and so be able to have that freedom of that and to always kind of be on time and accountable for being on time for meetings and stuff. I think is bringing so much value to the employer as well.</p>

<h6 id="1718">17:18</h6>
<p>I like that you say the value to the employer. That kind of, that hits a big topic as well, right? And I think it takes a good employer to recognize a good employee and the trust goes both ways, right?</p>

<h6 id="1731">17:31</h6>
<p>And you need to have a boss to manage correctly, manage remote workers correctly. That’s a whole other topic that we can probably get into you later on. Yeah, maybe we’ll do another episode over like proper scrum or like what works for us and how to like.</p>

<h6 id="1745">17:45</h6>
<p>stay accountable and on top of our task and the technology we used to do that. That’s a great topic. Yeah, that’d be cool. Um, yeah. So something else that, that is, that we don’t typically think of whenever you’re working in a, in a nine to five is if you are working remote, the nice part about this is employers can hire outside of the area code.</p>

<h6 id="1802">18:02</h6>
<p>So not only does that allow them as an employer standpoint to, to recruit better talent, you know, outside of their zip code, typically you can get cheaper talent because there’s not a ton of overhead.</p>

<h6 id="1812">18:12</h6>
<p>You don’t have to pay massive amounts of, of money to, to relocate that person and their entire family and, uh, things like that. But from an employee standpoint, from a worker standpoint, you can work different time zones.</p>

<h6 id="1826">18:26</h6>
<p>So if you’d like to wake up earlier, maybe you, maybe you live on central time zone, you know, the nice part about that is you can work kind of ahead and be able to work a different schedule, which allows you to get off work earlier in the day.</p>

<h6 id="1838">18:38</h6>
<p>You know, time with your family, things like that. Absolutely. Yeah. I actually work central time zone. I’m West coast. So I’m right now I’m two hours kind of behind, but you know, it’s kind of nice.</p>

<h6 id="1849">18:49</h6>
<p>I pretty much, I get up super early, um, and then I’m off about around three o ‘clock. So I think you’re kind of similar, but you do what central, but you were I’m one hour behind, I guess. So I work one hour ahead.</p>

<h6 id="1904">19:04</h6>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which is nice. So you get off around three, I get off around four and it’s, it’s great, especially if you have, you know, if you want to have, if you value that time off work and have a good work -life balance, especially if you have kids or a family, it’s, um, that, that time is so valuable.</p>

<h6 id="1919">19:19</h6>
<p>And most people are, you know, they get off at five, they’re trekking through traffic for 45 minutes to an hour. It’s, it’s a headache. Right. Um, something that brings me a lot of, uh, mental therapy is working from home is that I can work with my dogs in the room and the benefit of pets.</p>

<h6 id="1937">19:37</h6>
<p>I know you have some dogs and some other animals. And I think not only is that just a, a cool thing to, to think about, but it also allows me to work with my dogs. you to have a, you know, pets bring you a sense of calmness and support and to be able to have those little guys, fur babies, you know, with your feet to keep you company.</p>

<h6 id="1956">19:56</h6>
<p>You know, I think it adds a ton of value. I agree, man. I mean, you know, I pretty much walk all the dogs. I’ve got three dogs, so I’ll take them on walks and it’s perfect because I can just cut time out of my day and take them on a walk.</p>

<h6 id="2010">20:10</h6>
<p>And I’m sure they appreciate it as well. Exactly. And I get cooped up. Right. And my fiance works pretty long days. If I had to work in an office, well, they’d be here maybe eight, nine hours a day, not sitting there.</p>

<h6 id="2024">20:24</h6>
<p>So they’re happy to have dad home, huh? Yeah. That’s awesome. So I think before we get into the cons, I just wanted the, I think the biggest thing for me, the probably the biggest pro is the flexibility that you get from working remotely.</p>

<h6 id="2040">20:40</h6>
<p>You kind of touched on this a lot already, but I mean, there there have been times where you know, I’ll get a break in my day, I’ll go to the grocery store, I’ll go get a haircut, you know, you can do errands at random times, if you can cut out the time and, and that kind of goes back to, you know, building trust with your coworkers, your employer.</p>

<h6 id="2058">20:58</h6>
<p>Or if you work for yourself, then you’re good. But sure. I think that’s the coolest part is there’s there’s you kind of almost set your own schedule in some sort of like context of, you know, whatever your schedule should be.</p>

<h6 id="2112">21:12</h6>
<p>So I think that’s great points. And, and a part of the whole saving time and money. And the nice part of about working from home is, is typically the lunches that you would spend so much money eating out on, you get to, you know, go make yourself a sandwich or, or bake something or things like that.</p>

<h6 id="2128">21:28</h6>
<p>And you could, you could save so much time just in groceries and eating out. Which, which kind of is a good transition for cons. Because that’s, that’s one thing that I really miss being in office is that office culture, having lunches brought in on Fridays, you know, to just chat it up with folks and, you know, maybe play around a ping pong, things like that.</p>

<h6 id="2147">21:47</h6>
<p>Right. So, yeah, so I think that’s a, that’s a good, that’s, that’s definitely something that, that I, I miss, which I guess would fall into the con category. But, but some of the other things that, that we, we, we miss being remote workers is you don’t have that day to day kind of quote unquote water cooler talk.</p>

<h6 id="2206">22:06</h6>
<p>So you miss, you miss that face to face conversation with coworkers and that, that does sense, that does tend to build a lot of trust in relationships with, with your employers, staff members and managers to kind of be in person and kind of be visible and, you know, I don’t know if that’s something that you’ve necessarily missed out on.</p>

<h6 id="2229">22:29</h6>
<p>How do you feel about, you know, the, the, the lack of face to face interaction? Yeah, no, I totally agree. I mean, I do kind of miss some of the social interaction there that you get from, you know, being in an actual office space.</p>

<h6 id="2242">22:42</h6>
<p>Sure. You know, the first, I think I was talking about the social interaction, you know, being in an actual office space. earlier, the first job that I had working remotely, I had worked on site the entire time I worked there, and I kind of, I moved, went remote, and I missed so much of that culture, right?</p>

<h6 id="2256">22:56</h6>
<p>Like, that was, I actually wasn’t sure if I wanted to keep working remotely because I had missed it so much. Right. So you had a bit of a withdrawal going to the extremes, huh? Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, and, you know, a lot of the people who worked there didn’t work remotely.</p>

<h6 id="2313">23:13</h6>
<p>There was like one guy who worked remote. And so nobody really did video chats, that wasn’t really a thing. Whereas now, my company, I mean, I do video chats all the time with people. So I mean, you almost kind of get that face to face, but it’s still not the same.</p>

<h6 id="2326">23:26</h6>
<p>So yeah, it’s totally something I miss. And, you know, I still miss it’d be nice to, you know, get some more face to face interaction throughout the workday. But yeah, I think I think part of that is like, it’s definitely a con, like, it’s definitely something that’s kind of a culture shock.</p>

<h6 id="2344">23:44</h6>
<p>You know, typically if you have if you have a lot of that engagement office, it’s you definitely miss that right off the bat. I think that really comes down to leveraging the right technology, you know, and setting a setting a routine schedule for your team to, to take on the challenge of remote and, and not kind of be this outlier that this one person wants to be remote.</p>

<h6 id="2400">24:00</h6>
<p>So they, they have to kind of work around, you know, certain, certain, uh, standards and limitations. But if, if your team is, is more remote than it is not remote, or if you have a large amount of team members that are remote, I think part of it is just, is leveraging a proper amount of technology and, and, and scheduled routine calls to, to do daily check -ins and things like that.</p>

<h6 id="2421">24:21</h6>
<p>So that it’s, you know, it doesn’t feel so polarized. Yeah. I think you bring up a good point right there. The, you know, like leverage the technology, make the remote employees feel like they’re still part of the team.</p>

<h6 id="2434">24:34</h6>
<p>And I, I didn’t feel like I got that too much from that, from the first job I was remote. So, um, but I think you also brought up a good point about like the culture. Um, and you kind of also miss out on the company outings, right?</p>

<h6 id="2447">24:47</h6>
<p>So if, oh, that’s huge. Yeah. Yeah. If you go out to lunch, uh, just small things, like say, you know, you have like a party or something like you typically probably won’t, you probably will miss out on that unless you actually get the fly in or, you know, travel into wherever that is.</p>

<h6 id="2504">25:04</h6>
<p>Um, right. Yeah. I think if, if, if you’re an outlier and you’re trying to go remote and the rest of your team isn’t, you’re definitely going to probably lose that benefit. But, but a lot of teams that are dedicated to the remote lifestyle, typically they like to do like a yearly retreat, which, which helps kind of build that in person and do something fun outside of the office.</p>

<h6 id="2525">25:25</h6>
<p>So yeah. Yeah. And it’s, it’s a kind of all relative, right? It depends on who you work for the company. Um, I’d say the best company probably to get in with would be one that has a little bit of both, right?</p>

<h6 id="2536">25:36</h6>
<p>Um, either full or a little bit of both of remote employees. Yeah. So, so with the rise of this coronavirus and, and kids. being forced to stay at home or parents having to be home with their kids during this kind of crazy time that we’re going through right now is that’s a constant struggle regardless if the kids are forced to come home or not.</p>

<h6 id="2559">25:59</h6>
<p>Even if the kids are in school, they typically come home around two or three o ‘clock and so setting those limits and enforcing certain rules on certain office spaces was a huge lesson for me to talk to the kids and say, hey, this is dad’s office, you don’t knock on the door, I’m in meetings, there has to be this certain very strict separation between office and home and that’s not, even if you have kids or not.</p>

<h6 id="2629">26:29</h6>
<p>We’re going to get into that as we talk about these kind of pro tips and things that we have found to be so valuable when conquering remote work, but that is a constant constant struggle setting these certain barriers, you know, I’ve even thought like hey Like how do I like how do I need like a like a I’m recording light like Dad’s in his office like It’s it’s a silly thing but like, you know You know being able to have Have your kids around is great for when you’re taking lunches and stuff and having extra time for them in the evenings Because you don’t have to travel so much and you know that strenuous drive to working back But yeah, I can imagine man having having kids running around and I can’t really compare I mean the pets are or one thing.</p>

<h6 id="2719">27:19</h6>
<p>I mean sure my dog can open my door now. So that’s not great so I think one of before so we have to we want to get into like the pro tips for conquering remote work, but we uh, we also want to touch on I Well, sure and I think we kind of we touched on this briefly but pros and cons of employers and companies is is really setting that that relationship of trust and guidance and because there is there is no time to really quote -unquote micromanage so To being up being able to hire people that you trust is already a good thing regardless of if you’re in the office or not So it kind of sets a kind of a hard a hard stop to those that that you don’t trust with their arms reach and so being able to to just have those those certain standards and It really it really kind of cuts through those people that might necessarily not be a good fit for remote work.</p>

<h6 id="2820">28:20</h6>
<p>Sure So so what do you think about the companies that? Require you to have like remote experience before Taking a remote position because I don’t know if that’s still a thing but yeah, I think I think it’s I think it’s huge It’s it’s something that you know companies don’t want to hire people.</p>

<h6 id="2838">28:38</h6>
<p>They don’t have experience doing what they’re trying to get them to do because it takes time and money out of that company’s pocket to hire an onboard and to teach someone to be a remote employee. Part of that is, I think, just comes down to character traits regardless if you are in office or if you want to be a remote worker.</p>

<h6 id="2901">29:01</h6>
<p>But it really comes down to, is this someone that is a self -starter? And can you give this person a set of tasks or to play their role and fulfill their role and not have to be constantly checked on or takes an issue on things?</p>

<h6 id="2917">29:17</h6>
<p>I think that’s just huge as far as a personality goes. And again, remote work is not for everybody. And I think it goes back to the industry as well. It really depends on the industry you’re in and if that lends to being able to work remote, right?</p>

<h6 id="2932">29:32</h6>
<p>We’re fortunate that we’re in the software industry, so we can work remote. But again, like Eli said, it’s not really for everybody. You know, if you have a hard time staying motivated and focused, that could totally be a problem for you working remotely.</p>

<h6 id="2951">29:51</h6>
<p>And that’s why we’re going to get into some of the pro tips for Conkin remote work, because we can give you some good tips on how to avoid those distractions. So kick it off. For sure. Yeah. Some of these tips and tricks are something that is, it’s an ongoing trend to constantly monitor yourself and be kind of self aware of where you stand and your managers and your business’ eyes.</p>

<h6 id="3015">30:15</h6>
<p>And part of that is just, again, over communicating, being transparent, and having these conversations. You know, like, is this working out? Is how can I communicate better? Just, you know, being vulnerable and asking those questions, I think goes a long ways in a manager saying, oh, wow, this person really cares.</p>

<h6 id="3032">30:32</h6>
<p>And they’re not only are they asking the right questions that we can fulfill the answers, but I’m not having to tell them, hey, you need to communicate more. Hey, you need to reply faster to emails or be more involved in meetings.</p>

<h6 id="3045">30:45</h6>
<p>But this person is a self starter. So managers love that. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, if you don’t have to have a manager that’s kind of micromanaging you, then yeah, you did a good job. I mean, it kind of goes with anything.</p>

<h6 id="3059">30:59</h6>
<p>So as far as like, I think one of my biggest tips for starting remote work, if you’re looking to get into it or you’re just starting, I think it’s very important that you get a good office space or get a good area of whatever location you want to work in and make sure that’s a dedicated space for doing the work.</p>

<h6 id="3118">31:18</h6>
<p>Make sure you define. I think dedicated environment is like so important. Yeah, absolutely, man. Set the boundaries. Make sure that if you have family living with you or just make sure that they know that this is your space, that it’s you to find it specifically for work.</p>

<h6 id="3138">31:38</h6>
<p>approach it from the standpoint of, hey, I’m going into my office today. Like that’s how I look at it. Like, hey, I’m going into my office or, you know, when I leave my office, I usually set aside my work.</p>

<h6 id="3150">31:50</h6>
<p>I’m usually done with work and sometimes I’ll close the door. So I, you know, it feels that way. It feels like an office and I don’t, so I don’t go back in there to do something. Cause usually when I go into my office, I’m usually doing work and that’s kind of how, that’s how I’ve approached it.</p>

<h6 id="3205">32:05</h6>
<p>Yeah. I think separation of environment and like setting these, these really strict boundaries for yourself and for the people that live in the same house as you is so vital to being a productive member of your team and still carrying on the same value and efforts that you would if you’re in office.</p>

<h6 id="3223">32:23</h6>
<p>And obviously like you, you miss the drive -in to work, not necessarily the time suck it takes, but the kind of mental, meditation that whenever you’re driving in, maybe you’re listening to some music or mental or a podcast and being able to mentally think through your day of, this is what I’m going to accomplish.</p>

<h6 id="3240">32:40</h6>
<p>This is what I’m going to conquer today. Here’s the things that are kind of on my to -do list. And here’s the meetings that have coming up like that. That time is so valuable. So, um, you know, I think going to our next point routine is something that’s going to be so vital to, to your environment and, and being able to segment the difference between, you know, what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<h6 id="3301">33:01</h6>
<p>As far as really pulling apart, this is my home and this is my office space versus my home office. I don’t like to call it my home office, you know, cause I just lens to like, I’m at home. Yeah. I agree, man.</p>

<h6 id="3313">33:13</h6>
<p>I, yeah, it’s a good way to look at it. Home office. I don’t think I actually have ever called it my home office either. Yeah. I think most people that have like a nine to five in a traditional brick and mortar building, they, they say, Oh, this is my home office.</p>

<h6 id="3326">33:26</h6>
<p>Cause maybe they’ll do some paperwork or something on the weekends. Um, but when this is your, when this is your, you’re a quote unquote nine to five, you know, you’re 40, 45 hours a week. It’s, you know, it becomes a kind of a sacred space to, to, to limit and, and set those certain boundaries and, and routines is, is so important.</p>

<h6 id="3345">33:45</h6>
<p>So like I said, with driving into work and you, you miss that, especially with the detox of getting off work and you’re, you know, you’re taking that drive home and you can kind of reflect, I think those things are still relevant.</p>

<h6 id="3355">33:55</h6>
<p>And so being able to like, you know, maybe you get a cup of coffee in the morning and, and you have a certain routine that, that works for you. And, and for me, it’s like, it’s, it’s, it’s getting the kids out the door for school and having 15, 20 minutes just as a, as a quiet house.</p>

<h6 id="3410">34:10</h6>
<p>I think it’s so vital to get me kind of a good headspace. Yeah. And so, you know, if that’s getting a cup of coffee or making a, you know, my, my, my guilty pleasure right now is a cinnamon chai latte.</p>

<h6 id="3421">34:21</h6>
<p>Oh man. Speaking of my language. Yeah. I love, I love them. Um, maybe I had a shot of espresso. too deep. Yeah, it’d have been time how much sleep you could have guessed the night before. But having that time to get a cup of coffee and go through emails and go into the office, a bit of the computer, check your Slack or your communication channels to see where the team’s at, look over your tasks for the day.</p>

<h6 id="3452">34:52</h6>
<p>And I think those things are just so important to kind of prepare yourself for a successful day of work as you’re a remote employee. No, I totally agree. I mean, the routine is so important. I mean, you mentioned yours, I kind of do the same thing.</p>

<h6 id="3505">35:05</h6>
<p>I get up, make my coffee, I have to take all the dogs out, I feed the pets. You know, I’ll usually roll into my office and start looking at emails. Well, I think the same thing goes when you’re getting off work, right?</p>

<h6 id="3518">35:18</h6>
<p>So, you know, typically just things that work for me is when I get off, I’ll kind of shut everything down instead of like jumping straight from my computer into kind of being dad or… or being a supporting spouse is taking, even if it’s just five minutes, just to kind of look out the window and detox and reflect back on your day and things that went well, things that you could have done better.</p>

<h6 id="3543">35:43</h6>
<p>And, you know, and kind of whether you want to call it meditation or not, just kind of that detox time is I think is so vital to that in your routine that that’s that for me has been has been very beneficial.</p>

<h6 id="3556">35:56</h6>
<p>Yeah. And something we can definitely touch on and I want to hear about your daily routines and reminders, but setting like setting daily reminders and things and like recurring events, even if it’s silly is like setting a timer that reminds you to do these things, I think is is so key to feeling like you have a very productive and successful workday.</p>

<h6 id="3619">36:19</h6>
<p>You know, I think you and I both own Apple watches and, you know, you’ll, you’ll be in a stressful situation, but you’ll get a little, you’ll get a ding on your watch and it’s like, hey, you should probably breathe or you should probably, you should probably stand up.</p>

<h6 id="3634">36:34</h6>
<p>And, you know, like those are reminders, regardless of whether they came from Apple or, or like you, you tell yourself, hey, I’m going to set a reminder that every day I’m going to go to my office, and I’m going to do the first 15 minutes, I’m going to set it on my calendar to do this, and just carve it out in a calendar, do these certain things, even if it’s before the other employees come online.</p>

<h6 id="3656">36:56</h6>
<p>You know, even things like, you know, every day I’m going to set a set reminder at 1030 or 11am to send me a notification telling me to stand up just as a reminder. So if you have a standing desk, you know, hit that, that preset button, the desk rises, and then you kind of get in the routine of standing, you know, hopefully an hour or two a day.</p>

<h6 id="3717">37:17</h6>
<p>Yeah. No, and if you have those sort of mental cues, at some point, it’s going to come, it’s going to be routine to loop back to routine. But, you know, it’s just going to be something that you’ll do without needing the reminder.</p>

<h6 id="3729">37:29</h6>
<p>at some point. But I think you’re totally right. Like having the reminders available, like setting some time aside to, like detox, I really agree with you there. Because I think you hit some points earlier about, you don’t get to drive home, you don’t get to listen to a podcast.</p>

<h6 id="3745">37:45</h6>
<p>So it’s kind of nice to take like that, like 20 minutes after work, maybe just sit on your couch and chill, you know, listen to this podcast. Exactly. Yeah, one thing that I thought was so interesting, that I’ve tried to do over the last few days, when if you read any blogs or anything about remote work, is they try they tell you to implement the 2020 rule.</p>

<h6 id="3807">38:07</h6>
<p>And I think it’s, again, it’s one of those things that’s like easy to remember. And so you sit to remember like what it what it means and then a reminder to implement it. And so the rule of 2020 is for every 20 minutes, you take 20 to 30 seconds to break away from your screens and to kind of refocus on something that’s at least 20 feet away from you.</p>

<h6 id="3827">38:27</h6>
<p>And part of that is the concern of eye strain. So, you know, obviously if you’re working remote, you’re constantly glued to a monitor, whether if it’s a laptop or an external monitor and those things is glaring blue rays into your eyes, which can cause, you know, over time can cause significant damage.</p>

<h6 id="3844">38:44</h6>
<p>And part of that is just again, routine, right? So trying to just break out of like sitting here and doing this, but also like it kind of gets you to to snap out of like what you’re doing and, you know, refocus, I guess.</p>

<h6 id="3859">38:59</h6>
<p>And sometimes it’s good to just take a break and look at something far away or look out the window. No, I think one of my favorite things is, you know, having natural light in my office, right? Like I think that’s a huge tip is make your office space, you know, inviting, have good lighting, have natural lighting.</p>

<h6 id="3918">39:18</h6>
<p>You don’t want to make it like a dungeon, right? Like you don’t want to hate going into your office every day, right? Yeah, you should make your office your own kind of space. And obviously, you know, if you’re gonna be, if you’re gonna have a webcam open, be professional, you know, dress the part, you know, put on a nice shirt, maybe even set something in the background that’s visually interesting.</p>

<h6 id="3938">39:38</h6>
<p>So you’re not just staring at a white wall. It looks like you’re kind of in a weird third world country prison cell. Yeah, and even your laptop, right? Like I would argue, like have your laptop propped up so it’s a good angle.</p>

<h6 id="3954">39:54</h6>
<p>Like don’t have like a double chin thing going on where you’re just staring down at your laptop. You know what I mean? Exactly. It’s those small things that they do make a difference, right? Yeah. And I think you brought up a point about like, you know, dress nice and that’s a huge one, man.</p>

<h6 id="4008">40:08</h6>
<p>Like maintain your hygiene, you know, take a shower every day. It’s very important that you don’t lose like, you know, a track of the menial things that you kind of, you used to always do when you’d go into an office.</p>

<h6 id="4023">40:23</h6>
<p>It’s different when you’re working from home because, you know, you can easily just, just get out of bed and go straight to your office and just zone out. You know, but it’s very important that you have those reminders and the routine going back to that that.</p>

<h6 id="4038">40:38</h6>
<p>Well, speaking of, uh, you know, routine and setting reminders, something that has been so helpful for me is I call them culture convos and come whatever you want. But basically they’re just little, little daily micro meetings that, that have no agenda, uh, but to build relationships, uh, you know, trust and transparency with your coworkers.</p>

<h6 id="4058">40:58</h6>
<p>And, you know, whether you’re doing scrum calls or if you’re a software developer or if you have like kind of daily kind of standup calls with your team, having, having those little meetings, even honestly, if they’re five, 10 minutes, you know, three or four times a day with, with people that you work with.</p>

<h6 id="4113">41:13</h6>
<p>Literally the agenda is nothing except for avoid talking about work. You know, cause that’s that, that’s that quote unquote water cooler talk that, that it was a con on our list that you typically miss out on.</p>

<h6 id="4124">41:24</h6>
<p>But, um, you know, being able to, being able to just set up these meetings and, you know, put a terminal video, build build personality, these people talk about your family and friends and what you’re doing, what you did over the weekend, things like that.</p>

<h6 id="4137">41:37</h6>
<p>I think it’s just so valuable. Man, I totally agree. Like, and that also helps when so say, for instance, you have to travel and meet up with your co workers, that also helps in that sense, right? Like, if you guys find out that you have a hobby that you like together, then you guys can go hang out and go do that once you actually meet up in person.</p>

<h6 id="4155">41:55</h6>
<p>Sure, it’ll happen, you know, like what beard are you like? What are your kids doing? Yeah, exactly. You like hockey? Let’s go to a game. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I’ve been to so I travel for work and every city that I’ve gone to I’ll go with my co worker to a hockey game.</p>

<h6 id="4212">42:12</h6>
<p>We’ll try to find a game and just go. That’s awesome. We’re there. Like, let’s do it. So yeah, right. Take advantage of it. Exactly. But that’s a that’s a good good point, man. I think it’s really important just to have those video calls stay, like, you know, stay involved with the personal lives of your coworkers, even if you don’t see them every day, even if you don’t see them face to face, I think that that just keeps everybody kind of healthy, you know, yeah.</p>

<h6 id="4238">42:38</h6>
<p>Cool. So Eli, I wrote down some rapid fire questions for you. So the first one, what’s your best tip on minimizing distractions? Oh, that’s a that’s a good one. So a pro tip that has helped me out a lot is if you are on Mac OS, doing the the do not disturb on your OS devices or on your computer has been a lifesaver for me.</p>

<h6 id="4306">43:06</h6>
<p>And it has really helped me with kind of focusing, even if it’s like finding a podcast or or I or putting on like a Spotify channel that’s like a, it’s called like brain focus or something like that.</p>

<h6 id="4318">43:18</h6>
<p>And it’s honestly, it’s just like ambient noises. But that allows me to just really focus in and, you know, when I’m working from home, and maybe there’s, there’s, you know, kids around the hall or the neighbors moment is grass.</p>

<h6 id="4334">43:34</h6>
<p>If I have those things kind of in my head, it allows me to really focus in. Yeah, dude, that’s a really good point about the Mac. Yeah, dude, not disturbed. Yeah, I use that actually a good bit. I love it.</p>

<h6 id="4348">43:48</h6>
<p>All right, so next one, man. So would you ever go back to working in an office full time? Wow. That’s a loaded question. I think that there’s so much value when it comes to remote working. It took me probably six to eight weeks to really dive in and find my routine and my flow of remote work.</p>

<h6 id="4411">44:11</h6>
<p>But it would be a huge ask to get me back into office, honestly. Yeah. Yeah, now that you’ve tasted the sweetness of remote work and all the time and money you save that comes with it. Yeah, it’s it would be a it would be a pretty hefty ask to get me back into an office.</p>

<h6 id="4432">44:32</h6>
<p>Honestly. Yeah, I’m with you, man I’m 100% with you. Yeah. All right, my last one for you. There’s not too many this time. So do you think That more companies or teams are seeing the benefits of going remote nowadays Benefits yeah, I think that companies move very slow and It’s a big ask for companies that have been on the block for several Years to consider remote but we’re companies that are up and rising They’re moving a lot faster and part of that is that they are taking on these remote these remote Lifestyles and being able to recruit better talent and and putting more trust into their employees and in return that employee is gonna Is going to reciprocate that trust and build a better product for you and your company It’s a good way to put it Yeah, and I really hope you know this this coronavirus stuff blows over but you know And hopefully people find value in the tips that we have as far as remote goes But you know, it’s a crappy situation to have to go through to be forced to go remote So I can’t imagine what people are having to go through to just you know Have this certain routine of going in the office and stuff and now you’re kind of you kind of in this awkward stage of learning how to do that fully remote and leveraging the technology that maybe you’re not so comfortable with but Hopefully as as as bad as the situation is Companies can you know after weeks of people working remote start to see the value in it, you know, right?</p>

<h6 id="4602">46:02</h6>
<p>And I think you brought a good point saying that companies are slow Of course that’ll that’ll depend on the company but You know, I think probably startups, you know smaller companies definitely gonna be more towards the hey, let’s go Let’s go remote, you know sure So I’m hopeful that more companies and I you know, like you said, it sucks what’s going on right now with COVID -19, but hopefully you know, if one good thing can come out of it, maybe more companies will let their employees work remotely more often.</p>

<h6 id="4634">46:34</h6>
<p>I’ve got a rapid fire question for you, Ken. Do companies really see the value of this or do they think that employees just see it as a trendy word? That’s a really good question. I feel like it could go both ways.</p>

<h6 id="4652">46:52</h6>
<p>I think like the trend is, I think it’s trending that way, going remotely. But I think a lot of companies are kind of apprehensive. But in and also, I think it also goes back to what industry are you in, right?</p>

<h6 id="4708">47:08</h6>
<p>I mean, some companies, it literally just doesn’t make sense for anybody to work from home. Yeah, if you’re an electrician, you can’t really do that from home. Yeah. But even like software, I mean, I’m sure there’s companies out there that…</p>

<h6 id="4721">47:21</h6>
<p>You know, they follow a very like rigid standard of style and you have to go into the office, right? Like traditional standard. Yeah. Yeah, traditional, right? Cool. That’s awesome. I think that was a super valuable rapid fire that, you know, did you want to touch on a little bit of closing statements here, which is maintaining that work -life balance moving forwards?</p>

<h6 id="4743">47:43</h6>
<p>Yeah. So, you know, I think one of the, again, going back to kind of a pro, one of the biggest pros about working remotely as well, the flexibility, but with that comes maintaining a good work -life balance as well.</p>

<h6 id="4755">47:55</h6>
<p>I think it’s very easy to get caught up in your work. And I’m sure in our industry, there’s a lot of side projects that you could potentially do. So it’s, it’s very important to realize when, you know, it’s time to cut off the work.</p>

<h6 id="4809">48:09</h6>
<p>And go do like something healthy and, and maybe it is, you know, doing more programming or more design work. Maybe that’s like, you know, that’s totally fine. But I think it’s also very important to, you know, go do some workouts or go running, just stay healthy.</p>

<h6 id="4826">48:26</h6>
<p>Make sure you keep your work in check and don’t let it kind of overtake you as far as, you know, when you get the ability to work from home. Yeah. Being a remote employee, that’s definitely something that is easy to slip back into is, you know, I’m just going to go into my office where I’m going to take my laptop or my computer outside of the office.</p>

<h6 id="4845">48:45</h6>
<p>I think that, that is, is a slippery slope when it comes to that segregation between home and office. And for me, that’s, for me, it’s just constantly self -monitoring and trying to figure out what works for me, what routines I need to adjust.</p>

<h6 id="4901">49:01</h6>
<p>Don’t get comfortable and, and just constantly ask questions through, through people you work with and, and, and push to over communicate for sure. Awesome. Well, I really do hope you all found this episode insightful.</p>

<h6 id="4917">49:17</h6>
<p>We’re probably going to do way more episodes on just remote working in general, because that’s Obviously what we’re both doing. I think this episode was so value rich, like just had so many topics we touched on and like so much stuff.</p>

<h6 id="4930">49:30</h6>
<p>And I think we want to like really break down a few blog posts and some really detailed show notes for this stuff. So it’s a constant reminder, you know, for you guys to read it and go back on it, maybe even share it out to people that are looking to go and promote or even like send this to your employer so they can hear some of the values of some of the remote work and things that they should consider as a company.</p>

<h6 id="4952">49:52</h6>
<p>Absolutely. Awesome. So with that, I think we’re going to sign off, Ken. I appreciate you taking the time to talk remote work with us and we’re going to have a few special guests coming on next week.</p>

<h2 id="designing-with-code">Designing with Code</h2>

<p>The days of complex CSS hacks and legacy dependencies just to get a simple website to look good are gone.  There’s a continued conversation around the friction of Designers Learning Code and Developers Learning Design. My hope with this blog is that I can introduce you to some very simple concepts and techniques that make it super easy for any designer to understand the importance of learning some modern CSS.  So the next time you’re faced with speaking “dev lingo” with your fellow coworkers, you’ll have some tricks up your sleeve.</p>

<h3 id="the-old-way-and-new-way">The Old Way and New Way</h3>
<p>Before this huge wave of new/frequent browser releases, the internet was stitched together with legacy coding techniques like: HTML Tables, Image Maps, Floating Elements, Fixed Width’s, and other odd growing pains that we all have encountered.</p>

<h3 id="the-traditional-design-tools">The Traditional Design Tools</h3>
<p>As Designers are becoming more utilized in the web space, software companies like Adobe have crafted beautiful tools for any entry-level designer to pick up. These tools range from doing basic tasks such as wireframes to sophisticated tooling for creating high-fidelity mocks and basic prototypes. Tools like Adobe Dreamweaver attempt to bridge the gap between design input tooling and sophisticated code output. The problem constantly faced is the lack of knowledge on both sides, Design and Dev. It’s not easy for a developer to just pick up code output from these tools and seamlessly integrate with their current stack.</p>

<p>As a Digital Designer, it has made my life much easier to understand the root fundamentals of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/where-do-you-learn-html-css-in-2020/" target="_blank">HTML and CSS</a>. It levels the playing field of respect when a developer feels that their designer knows these base web languages. It also gives the designer much more appreciation for the complex issues that a developer faces on a daily basis. Big picture, the tools and knowledge base is what holds back Digital/Web Designers from becoming a better UX/Interactive Designers. It’s difficult to represent the UX from the UI when the “Experience and Interactions” are presented as flat mocks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to understand the possibilities and constraints of your medium in order to do the best design work that technology can allow for. There’s no better way to gain this understanding than knowing how to build your own designs.<br /><br />- Ben Lisefski</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The benefit of having designers who know basic web development is how frictionless it makes the process from the beginning stages of a design to the finalizing of the web project. Plus we all dream of being “Design Unicorns”, right.. ? ** ☕ helps too.</p>

<h3 id="so-lets-dive-in-and-take-these-simple-steps-to-accomplishing-great-design-through-code">So let’s dive in and take these simple steps to accomplishing great design through code.</h3>

<h4 id="a-typical-project-process-breakdown">A typical project process breakdown:</h4>
<h6 id="1-info-architecture-">1. Info architecture 📝</h6>

<h6 id="5-front-end-code-">5. Front-end code 🔮</h6>
<h6 id="6-back-end-development-️">6. Back-end development 🖥️</h6>

<p>I think <strong>step 3, 4 &amp; 5</strong> can be meshed into one fluid step. A design project should always start with defining the problems &amp; gather as much data as possible to construct the best designed solution.</p>

<h4 id="1-info-architecture">1. Info architecture</h4>

<p>Here are a few resources to gather some of that useful data:</p>

<ul class="list-dash">

</ul>

<h4 id="2-sketch--wireframes">2. Sketch &amp; Wireframes</h4>

<p>Best simply using Pencil &amp; Paper or whiteboard</p>

<p>This phase should be freeform &amp; allow you to rapidly produce a basic idea/concept with little to no commitment. Mix it up &amp; have fun with colored pencils. 🎨</p>

<h4 id="3-combining-uiuxfront-end-development">3. Combining UI/UX/Front-End Development</h4>

<p>This is not a one trick pony. Learning a few languages &amp; the fluidly implementing into your workflow can take months. Again, take baby steps.</p>

<p>Here is a list of resources that has greatly helped me over the years:</p>

<h5 id="css-flexbox">CSS Flexbox</h5>

<p>CSS Flexbox Module is revamping how designers/developers build out smart responsive components into their websites &amp; web-apps. The root functionality is “flexible” to any screen size &amp; device contents. Here are some resources to getting started with Flexbox.</p>

<h5 id="piggyback-off-a-lightweight-framework">Piggyback off a lightweight framework</h5>

<p>CSS &amp; JS Frameworks are great jumping off points when starting a large web project. They serve well as base components styles &amp; functionality that most websites &amp; web-apps utilize. Grab one of these well-known frameworks &amp; modify them to fit your web needs &amp; style.</p>

<p>There is so much value in Designers diving in &amp; understanding the utilitarian aspect of what they are designing for. I hope more designers are inspired to learn more Front-end tools &amp; create a more fluid working relationship with their development team.</p>

<h6 id="transcript">Transcript:</h6>

<h6 id="0000">00:00</h6>
<p>Hey everybody, this is Shop Talk Show number 282. Dave and I have a couple of guests on this week. And we’re gonna be talking about something that all of us should probably be doing a heck of a lot more of on our websites that we work on, but shamefully don’t.</p>

<h6 id="0019">00:19</h6>
<p>I wonder if you can guess what that is. And these two fellas work at a company that’s aptly named for that thing that we’re supposed to be doing. Anyway, Mr. Dave, please kick it off. [“Just Do It Like It’s Your Song”] Just do it like it’s your song!</p>

<h6 id="0051">00:51</h6>
<p>Hey there, Shop Ameniax. You’re listening to another episode of the Shop Talk Show. A podcast all about friend and web design and development. Chris, I’m testing out like an old version of our intro.</p>

<h6 id="0105">01:05</h6>
<p>What do you think? It was a test. It was a test, Chris. Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah. What were the results of the test? It was a control. And the control won my brain test, whichever would come out of my mouth.</p>

<h6 id="0121">01:21</h6>
<p>Chris, what’s happening today? We got people in the studio. Oh, I don’t know if they could tell, but we’re gonna end up talking. We’re gonna say the word test a lot of time. So if you hate the word test, this is not the episode for you.</p>

<h6 id="0131">01:31</h6>
<p>But you should listen to it no matter what because it’s an important part. It’s a vital part. It definitely comes along for the ride no matter what kind of developer you are. And we’re gonna be talking a lot about browser testing and automated testing, all kinds of testing.</p>

<h6 id="0147">01:47</h6>
<p>And we have two people who know a heck of a lot about testing because it’s kind of their job. These two fellas are from a company called Cross Browser Testing, which is a part of another company called Smart Bear.</p>

<h6 id="0200">02:00</h6>
<p>Testing, testing, testing. Anyway, let’s hear from them. We have Eli Brumley. Hey Eli. Hey, hey Chris, how are you? Good, good, good. Thanks for joining me and John Reese. Hi John. Hi. So tell us about stuff.</p>

<h6 id="0215">02:15</h6>
<p>Tell us about, you know, take turns, but I’d like to hear, you know, and I should say you do both work for cross browser testing, right? I get that. We do, yes, we both work for cross browser testing, a smart bar company, and we became a smart bar company back in April of 2016.</p>

<h6 id="0234">02:34</h6>
<p>It’s been a very, really awesome inquire from Smart Bar and we’ve gained a tremendous amount of effort into growing the platform and making it just a really seamless experience for, you know, the painful thing, which is cross browser testing.</p>

<h6 id="0251">02:51</h6>
<p>It’s an aptly named company, literally cross browser testing. When we say, I mean, people, the words cross browser testing just flow out of people’s mouths when they’re just talking about it as a concept.</p>

<h6 id="0300">03:00</h6>
<p>And it’s also the name of the company, which is a pretty wonderful thing. John, what’s up? What do you do for cross browser testing? I mostly do backend stuff. I handle a lot of our infrastructure and our Selenium work on our API a lot.</p>

<h6 id="0316">03:16</h6>
<p>So when it comes to testing, I know, I know a lot of the testing, but I don’t know a lot of what the testing is doing on the front end. And that’s where I come in. So my official title for cross browser testing is designer.</p>

<h6 id="0333">03:33</h6>
<p>I’m more of a UX UI guy and really just making sure that the marketing stuff is ship shape as well as taking some of these really powerful tools that the developers build out and making them an intuitive experience for the users.</p>

<h6 id="0349">03:49</h6>
<p>Cool. So we’re going to talk about cross browser testing in general and probably some about the company itself. You might recognize them. They are a sponsor of Shop Talk Show just a couple of weeks ago, I think.</p>

<h6 id="0400">04:00</h6>
<p>And I should mention like every other show on Shop Talk Show just because these guests happen to be from this company. This isn’t a sponsored episode of any kind. Just like if we have somebody from Microsoft on it’s not an ad for Microsoft.</p>

<h6 id="0414">04:14</h6>
<p>It’s just interesting because they know more than the average people do. Sorry, what’s that Chris? I’m in my cross browser testing boat. No, just get those briefcases of money we sent. Yeah, just just gifts, you know.</p>

<h6 id="0429">04:29</h6>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I will not bow to any sponsor. Says Garth. OK, Dave, you got a lot of stuff has been flowing through your mind here. I’m sure. Yeah. So can can we have a moment here of honesty? Testing is something I am not good at or I rare.</p>

<h6 id="0454">04:54</h6>
<p>I barely do, I don’t really excel. So I thought maybe the best place to start in having testing experts like y ‘all here, can we talk about the different types of testing you can do for websites? Can we get a general overview?</p>

<h6 id="0511">05:11</h6>
<p>Because I hear words like functional, unit, visual regression, what are these things and why do I use them and when do I use them? And yeah, can you take a stab at that? Yeah, sure. So I think there are kind of tiers of different testing, different levels of integration in your app.</p>

<h6 id="0534">05:34</h6>
<p>So you have unit testing, which is testing individual components, you know, kind of the atomic level of your application. And then integration. That’s the one that’s like, does my function called sum actually add two numbers together?</p>

<h6 id="0551">05:51</h6>
<p>And I’m going to write a test that says, I’m going to give this function one and two, and it better as hell return three. And if it doesn’t, you have a problem. Yeah. I think that isn’t usually what you see in the front end most of the time.</p>

<h6 id="0606">06:06</h6>
<p>You tend to see more integration tests. You want to know how your stuff interacts with each other, because that transfer of state is really when everything starts getting messed up. So an integration test is going to be integration tests or functional test is going to make sure that.</p>

<h6 id="0624">06:24</h6>
<p>Are those literally the same? I think so. I usually hear them used interchangeably. So at that point, there’s like URLs involved already, right? Like go here and do this. Yeah. Yeah. And you can either, you know, you can have your own, you can have code in your code that tests your own code.</p>

<h6 id="0647">06:47</h6>
<p>OK. But that gets real messy real fast. So a lot of times it’s easier to just get a browser pointed at your website and then have that do the testing. And that’s where slitting comes in. OK. It is an example of an integration test like I want to make sure that our login system works.</p>

<h6 id="0708">07:08</h6>
<p>So please fire up the browser, click the login button, enter these two, use this username and password, which I in this testing environment, I know should be accepted as a real login and password and then click the login button, fake click it essentially, right?</p>

<h6 id="0726">07:26</h6>
<p>And then success should happen. Like I don’t know what the success determination is, but maybe there’s a welcome screen and you test for the presence of the H1 on that welcome screen or something. Is that about right or?</p>

<h6 id="0741">07:41</h6>
<p>Yeah, I’d say that’s right. I think the words you use aren’t as important. It kind of changes depending on what the rest of your tests look like. But the important thing is just to have a test that tests your login page, whatever you want to call it, you should know that your login page works.</p>

<h6 id="0758">07:58</h6>
<p>Okay. Okay. So that’s, that’s different. There’s two kinds we just covered. There’s unit, which is like more of a backend thing. Usually you’re saying there’s not a lot of small tests. Yeah. And then integration, which involves a browser.</p>

<h6 id="0813">08:13</h6>
<p>Yeah. Integration or functional or acceptance. Lots of people have lots of different names, but I tend to think of it as kind of small tests versus larger system tests. And Selenium is like, is a major word and a major player here.</p>

<h6 id="0830">08:30</h6>
<p>So what is it? Right. So Selenium is how you tell that browser to go and do things to test your page. It’s the language. It is a, it’s a standard Selenium is a standard that defines how browsers should be able to be automated.</p>

<h6 id="0856">08:56</h6>
<p>Selenium define. That’s really, it’s a standard. So I could write something in Selenium. What I need permission to do that, is it a company too? It’s actually, it’s an open source project and there’s a W3 document.</p>

<h6 id="0915">09:15</h6>
<p>Really? A W3C document, yeah, defining the specification. Oh, I have no idea. Yeah, so Selenium is really just a set of standards and it’s up to the individual browser manufacturers, browser makers to implement that standard.</p>

<h6 id="0931">09:31</h6>
<p>So Chrome has their own, it’s called a web driver because it drives the browser. Chrome has their own web driver, Firefox has theirs, Microsoft has an edge driver and an IE driver. So in the same kind of way, it’s of they implement like accessibility tools into how their browser works and all that.</p>

<h6 id="0948">09:48</h6>
<p>It’s the same kind of thing. They need to have the, they need to standardize how this code can drive their browser. Wow. Exactly. Which can sometimes lead to some issues because they don’t always work the same way.</p>

<h6 id="1001">10:01</h6>
<p>Like Microsoft Edge, the Edge web driver was lacking some really main Selenium features until pretty recently. So you would try to run your test, it would work great on Chrome, it would work great on Firefox and then you try to run it on Edge and you’d get random failures just because your commands haven’t been implemented yet.</p>

<h6 id="1022">10:22</h6>
<p>No kidding. But they finally got around to making that better this past year. So essentially there’s like, I don’t know, go to this URL and fake click this button. That’s like, it’s standardized because I should be able to write a line of code that does that that works in any browser.</p>

<h6 id="1040">10:40</h6>
<p>Right. And a lot of those main ones, go to this page, go back, make sure this is here. Those are all good and standard, but you can also do weird stuff with Selenium. Um, like you can interact with certificates.</p>

<h6 id="1053">10:53</h6>
<p>You can install extensions. Um, I see you can, you can do a lot of. Interesting browser behavior, but just like web development, the, the basics are, are almost never a problem. It’s all these little, the weird stuff, the edge cases, the complications.</p>

<h6 id="1110">11:10</h6>
<p>The edge cases. This is interesting. I, I swear, I thought Selenium was like a company in San Francisco. So I’m learning a lot, but I go to the website and I’m like, maybe it’s from Seattle, but, um, though I was editing a, I was editing an article this morning that capitalized edge in edge cases.</p>

<h6 id="1132">11:32</h6>
<p>So it’s a, it’s a real thing. Nice. Uh, so when I, when I say, do I say, like catch me up on the lingo. It, do I fire up web driver or do I fire up Selenium? What’s, what do we, or do I fire up Selenium web driver TM?</p>

<h6 id="1150">11:50</h6>
<p>Yeah, your test is probably going to start with from Selenium import web driver. And that’s, so the thing that you’re interacting with is the web driver. If you’re using a service like us, it’s going to be a remote web driver, which means it’s going to be commanding a browser that’s not on your own machine.</p>

<h6 id="1209">12:09</h6>
<p>It’s just going to be sending commands off to be resolved somewhere else. Okay, because that was kind of my next question. When I run a web driver test, it works on my browser on Dave Rupert’s computer.</p>

<h6 id="1225">12:25</h6>
<p>It fires up that one, that instance, and drives it around and then disappears, like exits out. Is that how that works? Yeah. So when you’re running it locally, it just hooks right into the browser process, basically.</p>

<h6 id="1239">12:39</h6>
<p>Your code talks to the Chrome web driver, if you’re testing Chrome, and then you send standard commands, standardized commands to the Chrome web driver, and it will turn them into system level calls to mess around with the browser.</p>

<h6 id="1258">12:58</h6>
<p>And you don’t see it. It is kind of like, because we hear all the time recently about headless Chrome and headless Firefox, and everybody wants their headless browser. Why is that new? Selenium’s been around way longer than that.</p>

<h6 id="1313">13:13</h6>
<p>Yeah, I think the main difference is just that with Selenium, it’s actually not headless. You see it running. You can get a video of it running. Oh, it’s not headless. It’s not headless. I think you can use it with headless Firefox and Chrome, but I think there’s something really nice about being able to actually watch it run.</p>

<h6 id="1334">13:34</h6>
<p>That’s kind of cool. We can watch the… Can you be like, move cursor to here and watch it move the cursor over there? Yeah. Wow. It’s fun to watch it like someone else just… Manning your browser for a bit doing your testing for you.</p>

<h6 id="1350">13:50</h6>
<p>Yeah, in a way, it’s like a yeah It’s like a QA person that you programmed a little testing robot Exactly. Okay. So what what kind of testing is it when you just like open it up in Firefox instead of Chrome and look at it?</p>

<h6 id="1405">14:05</h6>
<p>Yes, that’s that’s main testing or just visual testing legacy testing legacy. Yeah Whoa, whoa real world I like to call it. Yeah, it’s I think it’s I think it’s very it’s I think it’s still relevant You know the future is the future is automation and doing more rapid You know visual testing which we have solutions for that we talk about in a bit But the whole manual testing is kind of spot -checking going through Clicking on elements and this is more for just kind of smaller tasks that you want to make sure things Things are seamless.</p>

<h6 id="1438">14:38</h6>
<p>You know a lot of manual testing is also good for accessibility and general usability because a lot of those things you have to go into the console and just kind of check, you know, make sure your, your title tags are there and things like that that are more monotonous task.</p>

<h6 id="1453">14:53</h6>
<p>Um, but let this still extremely important for obviously having a good accessible website. I hear it called a exploratory testing a lot. That’s kind of a, Oh, I love that. Oh yeah. That means you’re just going around poking around.</p>

<h6 id="1509">15:09</h6>
<p>Oh, I’m a pro at exploring. Or just seeing what you can break. It makes it seem so level 70 wizard. Yeah. There we go. Well, I mean, but the reason you might want to do this. So I’m on like cross browser testing .com, right?</p>

<h6 id="1522">15:22</h6>
<p>There’s a, there’s like a hero thing at the top and then right below it or right between the next two sections, there’s three boxes set in a row next to each other. Classic web design action. These three boxes next to each other.</p>

<h6 id="1536">15:36</h6>
<p>Um, well, what’s inside of them are the three types of testing, at least according to you, which is cool. But if you look in your web inspector and you see there’s a section tag around them with a class name of triptych around it, triptych is display flex and it has properties and stuff.</p>

<h6 id="1553">15:53</h6>
<p>This might be the kind of moment where in exploratory testing, I might just pop that baby open and, uh, maybe a mobile environment to see what happens to those three boxes or make sure that the way that I’ve written my flex box code works as far back as I could and stuff.</p>

<h6 id="1609">16:09</h6>
<p>And that’s just straight up that. I mean, but the only way to do that is exploratory testing. Really, right? It is unless you kind of flag things on a visual level or automated level, uh, you know, you find something that’s kind of broken or, uh, erring out in your layout.</p>

<h6 id="1627">16:27</h6>
<p>And so with that, then you’d go into kind of the lower level, um, focus testing, like, you know, visual testing and then going into debugging mode, uh, or just going through and trying to, you know, maybe you need to go and write some support tags for flex box or, or do some legacy stuff based on what you’re trying to represent in your browser.</p>

<h6 id="1646">16:46</h6>
<p>Yeah, I think that kind of bug that you want to catch specifically is great with our screenshot system or just screenshots in general because you can really quickly just visually confirm how your site looks across a bunch of different browsers.</p>

<h6 id="1703">17:03</h6>
<p>You can just get 20 different phones to run screenshots and then see in a minute that, oh yeah, everything looks the same or oh man, on this one weird phone, these buttons just are completely out of whack.</p>

<h6 id="1718">17:18</h6>
<p>Sure. So these are very different things. I mean, we just got done talking about Selenium and whatever weirdness that is. Probably the, I don’t know, the kind of person that spends a lot of time in that world and writing those tests is, I don’t know, in my experience, a different human being than the one who is looking at screenshots and shots to test how FluxBox is working across.</p>

<h6 id="1745">17:45</h6>
<p>They’re like different jobs almost. Yeah, I mean, I think it’s just different tiers of testing. So if it’s, you know, if you have a kind of a smaller site that just needs to get some spot checking, I think manual testing and using visual screenshots is definitely the way to go.</p>

<h6 id="1759">17:59</h6>
<p>But if you have, you know, for instance, Jenkins tasks set up, so every time you deploy, you’ll have Jenkins run a Selenium test, you know, to check A, B and C. That’s where, you know, kind of those rapid testings for Selenium is where you’re really going to benefit and save a lot of time.</p>

<h6 id="1819">18:19</h6>
<p>And that’s more on, you know, it might be a larger scale company that’s pushing out a lot of products, pushing out a lot of web presence, and every time you build some new component, you know, run, deploy this thing via Jenkins and run these screenshots against these things, go click in, log in, do your magic, whatever kind of funnel you want to have set up.</p>

<h6 id="1842">18:42</h6>
<p>And then from that, you can go through and just kind of spot check which one passed, which one failed, and then see why they failed if you need to go into kind of exploratory testing or manual testing and fix some of those errors.</p>

<h6 id="1853">18:53</h6>
<p>Yeah, I think whether or not you automate really just depends on how mission critical you think not having any bugs is. You know, if it’s a checkout process, you’re going to want to have that tested.</p>

<h6 id="1906">19:06</h6>
<p>That is not something you want breaking. If it’s, you know, just a marketing page for a special offer, that might be something that you only want to visually check, spot check, to make sure it looks okay.</p>

<h6 id="1919">19:19</h6>
<p>Maybe a little Selenium test to make sure people can sign up. But it really just depends on how much you want to invest in making sure your stuff works. And do y ‘all recommend like Jenkins for those don’t know, it’s like a testing environment, right?</p>

<h6 id="1938">19:38</h6>
<p>You kind of program it like, hey, do these rules and everything should succeed. And then you can even do a test. either pass or fail to build, right? Do you recommend that like at the, like I guess like pre -commit level or the pre -merge level, where should we be testing and rejecting if it messed up?</p>

<h6 id="2003">20:03</h6>
<p>I think the, you definitely wanna have something run a full suite of tests before you push to production. It’d be kind of a waste to not run tests when you’re about to deploy. And I, you know, it’s always a trade -off between how much time and resources you wanna devote to testing and how important it is that your stuff is tested.</p>

<h6 id="2027">20:27</h6>
<p>So a lot of QA teams have what are called smoke tests, which are simple, fast tests to just make sure something builds and basically works and they’ll run those smoke tests on smaller commits or… on different branches, say when they push to a test environment or a dev environment.</p>

<h6 id="2049">20:49</h6>
<p>So they’re not using their resources. They’re not running their full test suite every time they make a little commit. What? Okay, so it’s interesting. I work with a lot of clients and it’s always risk averse.</p>

<h6 id="2110">21:10</h6>
<p>Something happened, like somebody pushed a bug that broke IE 10 and now everyone’s afraid to commit because somebody broke IE 10 once. And so I think this automated testing would be really good. But what’s the process for making a test?</p>

<h6 id="2131">21:31</h6>
<p>Is it difficult? Does it take a lot of time? What’s the learning curve for something like Selenium? And could you walk through? It’d be mouth coding, but setting up a how to test a login form with WebDriver.</p>

<h6 id="2149">21:49</h6>
<p>Yeah, there are so many different ways. If you really need to just get something out fast and do something really easy, there are ways to record your actions in a browser that will spit out. Really? That’s cool.</p>

<h6 id="2205">22:05</h6>
<p>Yeah, Selenium IDE and Selenium Builder are two Firefox plugins that can just take all of your actions and just spit out a Selenium script at the end. See, that seems too easy. And it kind of is. The tests that it spit out tend to be pretty brittle.</p>

<h6 id="2225">22:25</h6>
<p>A lot of times they use X paths, which, you know, if… That’s rough test. That’s rough stuff. That’s rough stuff. It’ll work in a pinch, but if you really wanna make something that’ll last, you can…</p>

<h6 id="2237">22:37</h6>
<p>At least you can look at the code, though, then at the end and be like, oh, I see what they’re doing here. Let me clean this up a little bit. That’s true. That’s something you can totally do. You know, go and see wherever it’s using an X path and change that to use an ID.</p>

<h6 id="2250">22:50</h6>
<p>Is the code, is the code like JavaScript or I assume it’s probably its own like DSL or something. But is it like I can, can I query selector and things like that or? Yeah, the there are Selenium language bindings for basically any programming language you want to use, even Haskell has Selenium binding.</p>

<h6 id="2314">23:14</h6>
<p>If you just really hate yourself. Whoa. I mean, that’s like, that’s, you dropped Haskell and so now it’s getting full nerd. So if you’re using the JavaScript bindings, which I feel like a bunch of front end developers would be comfortable in.</p>

<h6 id="2338">23:38</h6>
<p>You just, you import your web driver. or you require it, and then you tell it to, you give Selenium commands to run, say you want it to go to a URL, you say driver .get, and then the page you want it to go to, and then that’ll return a promise, and you end up having a kind of a chain of promises that either get resolved or rejected, depending on whether or not they pass or fail.</p>

<h6 id="2411">24:11</h6>
<p>So you can also have commands that check to make sure the text in one of your links is what you expect it to be. I think we get the point though. There’s ways to do this, and you can write it in JavaScript if you want to, but it’s kind of amazing that you can write it in whatever you want as well.</p>

<h6 id="2432">24:32</h6>
<p>Okay, let’s say the test is done, you have it, it’s working. Isn’t it kind of part of the beauty of cross browser trusting that, okay, I wrote the test and it passes in Chrome, does it also pass in IE 10?</p>

<h6 id="2447">24:47</h6>
<p>How do I run it in multiple browsers? Well, one of those ways is to use a tool, right? Right. So the first thing your Selenium script does is it sets up that web driver, which is what’s gonna run all of your commands.</p>

<h6 id="2508">25:08</h6>
<p>And if you’re running on our infrastructure, you just tell it what browser you want. You can say, I want Edge and we’ll just give you an Edge, or I want Safari 10 and we’ll set up Safari for you. And because Selenium is a thing, I don’t need to change my code for those browsers.</p>

<h6 id="2523">25:23</h6>
<p>Right, you don’t need to change anything, you just need to ask, you just need to tell it what you want to test on. Wow, cool. And that’s the same kind of way, because to be honest, the way I use tool like cross browser testing is mostly the manual testing stuff.</p>

<h6 id="2537">25:37</h6>
<p>And there’s a comparison there, because I just, I log in to the test center and I drop in a URL. and I make that same choice, although I make it with my eyeballs and my mouse. I click, I want this platform and this browser and please fire me one up and then it does that.</p>

<h6 id="2555">25:55</h6>
<p>So just in case people didn’t know, I bet there’s a ton of front -end developers and designers who are well aware of the tool like this, but if there haven’t, I mean, this didn’t exist forever, this type of ability.</p>

<h6 id="2608">26:08</h6>
<p>It’s, you know, in the grand scheme of things is fairly new and it’s pretty amazing. And this idea is like, oh, my thing could be broken in IE9. How am I gonna do that? The historical way to do that would be like, it’s gonna be a pain in the ass.</p>

<h6 id="2624">26:24</h6>
<p>Like I should fire up a VM that has IE9 on it. And I think Windows provides one for testing for free, but still it’s a VM and I need a, you know, I gotta get a copy of Windows running or something, or, The stage after that was that there was a screen testing tools.</p>

<h6 id="2641">26:41</h6>
<p>Like give it this URL and I’ll give you a JPEG back of what it looks like in that browser, which is pretty cool. And cross browser testing can do that too. And the advantage there being that you can get 30 screenshots back pretty quickly, which is pretty valuable.</p>

<h6 id="2656">26:56</h6>
<p>But it doesn’t give me a click aroundable web inspectable version of IE9. One of the things that cross browser testing can do is that can fire me up some IE9 right in my Mac on Chrome without spinning up a VM, without doing any of that.</p>

<h6 id="2715">27:15</h6>
<p>I it’s just like a version of IE9 in my browser, which that’s the part to me that still amazes me to this day. I’m sure it’s old hat, especially for those of you that work there. But it’s kind of amazing that you can do that at all.</p>

<h6 id="2727">27:27</h6>
<p>It feels pretty magical to be able to just fire something up and within seconds you’re in a session and can just debug things on the fly and then switch configs. And before you know it, you could kind of rapidly test your stuff on a manual level.</p>

<h6 id="2744">27:44</h6>
<p>And I think it’s still relevant. But using things like the screenshot engine is there’s a lot of stuff that we’ve implemented with our screenshot engine like Slenium. So you can actually write a Slenium script in running against our screenshot engine.</p>

<h6 id="2758">27:58</h6>
<p>So say you have an internal dashboard that’s kind of log in panel or something that you have to prompt a few steps to get to. Oh, no kidding. So these two things can kind of work together. Like go to this URL and click this and then hopefully that modal is there.</p>

<h6 id="2816">28:16</h6>
<p>I’ll see that modal in the screenshots. Exactly. Yeah. You can also request to record videos with Slenium. So say back to the screenshot example if you’re doing just kind of rapid visual testing, if you need to write a Slenium script to get past a login form or add things to the cart, then you can request your screenshot at various stages.</p>

<h6 id="2838">28:38</h6>
<p>upon that versus going in manually clicking elements to get to that view and then requesting a screenshot. Wow. And look at this and then you can even get a little video of it if you want to. Yep. That’s something else.</p>

<h6 id="2852">28:52</h6>
<p>It’s a brave new world, you guys. This episode of Shop Talk Show is brought to you by Full Story. That’s fullstory .com slash Shop Talk, which is the URL you want to go to because then you get a free month of Full Story Pro with no credit card or no commitment or anything.</p>

<h6 id="2909">29:09</h6>
<p>A free month of what, you might ask, what is Full Story? It’s a session recording tool. It takes about 10 minutes to install it into your app. Just a little JavaScript snippet. You get in there, maybe pass it a little information about what’s going on at the page and starts recording sessions.</p>

<h6 id="2924">29:24</h6>
<p>It’s essentially recording the DOM. It’s really amazing what it can do. Whatever I say here can’t do it justice. You’ve got to go try it out because it’s So amazing. But you can then, you know, it’s recording users using your website and, you know, feel free to put in a little logic there of what you want to record and when and all that stuff.</p>

<h6 id="2942">29:42</h6>
<p>But it’s literally you just watch people use your site then, watch them navigate around, watch them interact with your site. And you’re seeing exactly what they’re seeing. And it’s not even a video. It’s like, like I said, it’s kind of like recording the DOM.</p>

<h6 id="2955">29:55</h6>
<p>So you can say, you know, search around, show me when people clicked on the button with this ID and it will narrow selections to that. It will show you frustrated users and rate you against other apps kind of anonymously, you know, to show you how you’re doing and that kind of thing.</p>

<h6 id="3012">30:12</h6>
<p>It’s really pretty incredible in what it can do. So go to fullstory .com slash shop talk and get the free month, get it up and running on your site in 10 minutes and can start understanding how people are using your site.</p>

<h6 id="3025">30:25</h6>
<p>You know, they people like Dropbox use them, Wisty, Zenfits, Shopify, lots of companies use it. I use it. I think it’s awesome. Thanks, full story. OK, so I think we’ve covered the types of testing. There’s this like very manual or what were we calling it?</p>

<h6 id="3045">30:45</h6>
<p>Exploratory. Exploratory. I love that. And there’s the screenshot stuff, but the screenshot stuff is related to, you know, it’s you get a lot more of it quickly and it can be tied to this automated Selenium stuff too, which is writing code to explicitly telebrow or what to do.</p>

<h6 id="3104">31:04</h6>
<p>And you can also drive the screenshot system with through Selenium and with an API call, you know, you can have your Jenkins kickoff a screenshot test. OK, wow, there’s a lot there. So, Dave, where do you want to?</p>

<h6 id="3121">31:21</h6>
<p>There’s plenty of places to go here. But do you have thoughts on that whole world? I would love to hear some anecdotes, maybe. Like, what are like the. What do people actually catch with this? Yeah, what bugs are we catching here?</p>

<h6 id="3137">31:37</h6>
<p>Or like, do we have any good anecdotes of like things people found? Or, you know, I always think of this time, I have this app called Daytrip. I like ship some code and it was broken. And the login form was broken in IE, or wait, no, it was broken in mobile Safari.</p>

<h6 id="3203">32:03</h6>
<p>And I was like, oh, that’s bad. So I think what I did is I was like, oh, I don’t have like a fetch polyfill. So I put a fetch polyfill in there and it’s like, okay, I fixed the signup form. I’m done, cool, goodbye, have a nice weekend.</p>

<h6 id="3219">32:19</h6>
<p>And then it’s like, oh, it doesn’t work in Edge because Edge didn’t have promises either. And so you need, Promise polyfill to make the edge polyfill or the fetch polyfill work to make it all work altogether.</p>

<h6 id="3232">32:32</h6>
<p>And I just was like, I just, I like broke down basically because I was like, how am I supposed to test this? Like, you know, like I could have like, sure I could have like set up all this automated testing and like, you know, every commit I ran it through 4 ,000 browsers or whatever.</p>

<h6 id="3249">32:49</h6>
<p>But like, I guess like, what kind of things should I be testing? And then what are, what are like dumb, useless or overly hard things you see people testing when they like are building things out? Yeah, I can just speak a little bit to that.</p>

<h6 id="3305">33:05</h6>
<p>So I think there’s this glamorous rumor that all browsers have to look the same. And consistency is good for obviously usability and for Google sake, you know, that they want to make sure that usability is consistent across all platforms and browsers.</p>

<h6 id="3321">33:21</h6>
<p>It’s extremely important for any kind of SEO impact and accessibility testing. But the biggest thing is, you know, that truth is actually not true at all. It’s every browser is different. There’s thousands of resolutions.</p>

<h6 id="3336">33:36</h6>
<p>There’s thousands of devices. And with each advice, there’s dozens of browsers or a handful of browsers you can put on each of those. So it can be quickly overwhelming to think about what you’re up against.</p>

<h6 id="3349">33:49</h6>
<p>But I think the biggest thing to just focus on is one thing at a time and using the tools to your advantage. And part of that is, except in the fact that not everything’s gonna look the same in all browsers.</p>

<h6 id="3404">34:04</h6>
<p>You know, unless you’re building everything in tables, that’s not gonna happen. I’d say especially if you’re building everything in tables, that’s not gonna happen. Yeah, I mean, you know, everything’s evolving, everything’s changing.</p>

<h6 id="3416">34:16</h6>
<p>You know, every phone that comes out from Samsung and Nexus every few months, it’s gonna have a different resolution. You get this new iPhone X, not iPhone X. that has this notch at the top. Of course, you know, Chris did a fantastic blog on CSS tricks on the notch, working around that notch in landscape mode.</p>

<h6 id="3436">34:36</h6>
<p>So good blog to check out. So there’s just various things to. Oh, you don’t have you don’t have iPhone 10 on cross for the testing. Now, yeah, we’re working on it. One has. Keep an eye out for it. OK, we’re keeping our eyes.</p>

<h6 id="3448">34:48</h6>
<p>Yeah. Oh, that’s yeah, I want to see that monstrosity. Sorry. OK, OK. So all right, keep going, keep going. I feel like it. Yeah. So with, you know, kind of the big starting question is, what do you test?</p>

<h6 id="3505">35:05</h6>
<p>You know, because it can quickly be overwhelming. And so with that, I highly recommend Google Analytics. You know, everybody that has a website should have some form of analytics set up. Google’s the best.</p>

<h6 id="3516">35:16</h6>
<p>And so with Google Analytics, that’s really where I typically start to test if I’m building out front end sites. And so. What is Google Analytics telling you? Yeah, so Google Analytics will tell you OS type.</p>

<h6 id="3530">35:30</h6>
<p>It’ll tell you what browsers are being used by your traffic, your visitors, as well as those dates fluctuate month to month and week to week because browsers are constantly being updated, as well as people are getting new devices.</p>

<h6 id="3544">35:44</h6>
<p>So as these things constantly roll out, you have to be on top of what your code supports and what your users are using. So for instance, if you are running a trendy, cool mobile app, you might have a lot of really relevant up -to -date browsers that support things like Grid or Flexbox.</p>

<h6 id="3604">36:04</h6>
<p>But if you’re a university or, for instance, a hospital, you might be working in IE 7, 8, 9 that has to have support because if that stuff is broken, it can be mission critical. You’ve got to know what your customers are using and write your tests to make sure that the most…</p>

<h6 id="3624">36:24</h6>
<p>so that you can cover the majority of your users and make sure that their experience is good, whether they’re a bunch of developers running Canary Chrome or a bunch of people in a senior home who are stuck on IE 8 in their Windows XP box.</p>

<h6 id="3642">36:42</h6>
<p>Yeah. I mean, in every site, every configuration of the user and browser in OS is going to be different. You could assume things, but the smartest way to do it is just design with data and test with data.</p>

<h6 id="3656">36:56</h6>
<p>And so say you’re building this new hip website and it’s all built in Grid, but then you realize that the website is for selling wheelchairs to senior citizens and everybody is an older config. Well, your checkup process might work in the latest version of Chrome and everything looks beautiful with your new CSS Grid, but it’s a horrendous experience for anybody on IE.</p>

<h6 id="3718">37:18</h6>
<p>And so those are the types of things you just have to really dig into the data first before you can start thinking about what tests… so they’re gonna best fit your use case. Okay, cool. I would think there’s some, like if you just sat and thought about it, you’d have some intuition as to what, what’s the first test I wanna write.</p>

<h6 id="3737">37:37</h6>
<p>And hopefully that intuition is based on like, what if I, what is like perennially screwed up this team and this project? Or I don’t know if that’s the right word, but just over and over. Like for example, there was like, I don’t know, it was a little while ago now, but it seemed like every little change we made at CodePen would somehow screw up the mobile version of our editor.</p>

<h6 id="3755">37:55</h6>
<p>We have like kind of a different, we have a different view. It loads like different HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the, for the mobile editor, but it’s still like digest the same data and largely has the same options available to it.</p>

<h6 id="3807">38:07</h6>
<p>But we’d like add a new option or something to the desktop editor and, you know, that’s the primary, you know, people use that, you know, a hundred times more than the mobile editor on our site. And then, but the mobile one wouldn’t be aware of that feature because we forgot to just pop in there and just make it aware of that data.</p>

<h6 id="3825">38:25</h6>
<p>And JavaScript, any little thing can just be like, oh, here’s some data that I don’t understand. I’ll stop processing all JavaScript, because that’s how JavaScript likes to roll. And we’d be like, oh, we literally ruined the entire mobile editor.</p>

<h6 id="3840">38:40</h6>
<p>Like it hit an error and it didn’t even get to the point where it loads the code into the friggin’ editors. So it might be a moment where we’d stop and be like, OK, that needs a test. That just it needs a test of some kind to make sure that that doesn’t happen.</p>

<h6 id="3854">38:54</h6>
<p>It’d be kind of neat if there was a way to write a really generic test to be like, does this page experience any JavaScript errors? Please tell me that. Oh, man. Yeah. If you get really invested into your Selenium, some of the most beautiful automated Selenium, I guess, implementations I’ve seen by companies, they basically build their entire custom framework.</p>

<h6 id="3919">39:19</h6>
<p>So they’ll have what they call page objects, which describe different functionality. They describe what kind of elements should be in the page and how those elements should interact. And they’ll have functions that describe how users can interact with those different elements.</p>

<h6 id="3940">39:40</h6>
<p>So kind of a super modular way to test. So they’ll have like, oh, I want to test my login and check out flow. So they’ll say, I want to go to my login page objects. I want to run this login function that tests all of your login things.</p>

<h6 id="4002">40:02</h6>
<p>And then I just want to add something to my cart. So you’ll say product page dot add to cart. And that’ll kick off an entire suite of actions that adds something to your cart and make sure that way you added to your cart is what you thought you were adding to your cart.</p>

<h6 id="4021">40:21</h6>
<p>You can end up with these really beautiful, expressive, generic tests that you can kind of compose together to just test all of your functionality. It’s an investment, but man, once you get that stuff set up, it is like testing nirvana.</p>

<h6 id="4041">40:41</h6>
<p>It’s funny though, is there, now that I’ve thought of this little micro idea in my head, it makes me wonder, is there a way to set up Selenium or anything else just to be like, yeah, I want to write these like nuance tests too.</p>

<h6 id="4055">40:55</h6>
<p>I want to get to testing nirvana. But I also want a test that says go to this URL and did all the JavaScript execute without an error, just of any kind. Yeah, totally. One of our co -workers, Tony Colston, actually just did a talk.</p>

<h6 id="4113">41:13</h6>
<p>I forget what conference he was at. I think it might have been the Smart Bear Conference. He did a talk about kind of managing JavaScript errors in the JavaScript console in Selenium. So it’s a, you can totally do it.</p>

<h6 id="4128">41:28</h6>
<p>That would just, that seems like a great test because it seems like was error? Yes, then tell me please, because that’s, you know, you can’t tell until you go to that URL and look. Yeah, that seems like a great way to get started.</p>

<h6 id="4141">41:41</h6>
<p>I imagine that would catch a lot of, you know, not a lot of them, but to get a lot of people. They’re the most embarrassing errors too. They’re like, oh my God. Just to straight up, it’s like, you know, one, some kind of dumb little, I’d say missing semicolon, but that’s two.</p>

<h6 id="4156">41:56</h6>
<p>Yeah, or like, oh God, I forgot to check if this property exists. And now my entire site’s just a black page. That’s it, yeah. I mean, Dave, that just, you know, you were just lamenting that the other week, you know, how you have to check if properties exist all the time.</p>

<h6 id="4211">42:11</h6>
<p>And it’s just sort of the pain of, you know, everybody wants to go vanilla JavaScript, but you forget sometimes the pain of that. Yeah, yeah, just, I think that’s like, you know, recently the difference between CSS and JavaScript has been like a big, big topic or whatever.</p>

<h6 id="4229">42:29</h6>
<p>But, you know, CSS is like, I didn’t get it. I’m just gonna skip it, but, you know, yeah, I’m just gonna just skip it in JavaScript. Like, you can’t, you can’t set an attribute that doesn’t exist, man.</p>

<h6 id="4244">42:44</h6>
<p>Or like, you can’t get an attribute that doesn’t exist. I’m dead, I’m out, okay, sorry. You did this, you did this to me. You did this, I’m not the bad guy here, I’m JavaScript. No, that’s, I think that’s the like, I feel like, just the nature of JavaScript.</p>

<h6 id="4303">43:03</h6>
<p>And I think we’re all seeing, you guys probably actually, probably have metrics on like how much JavaScript you’re processing. But, you know, people are moving over to JavaScript more and more depending on it to render pages, build things, you know, submit things.</p>

<h6 id="4317">43:17</h6>
<p>I feel like the fact that it is so brittle and just one, I guess, wrongly type thing can just explode you is something, you know, I think that’s worth testing. Actually read, this is tangential, but somewhat related.</p>

<h6 id="4333">43:33</h6>
<p>I read a academic paper about using strong type languages like TypeScript or Facebook’s Flow. And they said, you know, just, just implementing a strong type system into like open source repos could solve like 15% of all bugs just because people like, just because you have a strong type system, it like reduces the number of bugs.</p>

<h6 id="4359">43:59</h6>
<p>And that’s just to say, like, you probably have 15% of your errors because somebody like is trying to pass a number in or a string into an addition function. You know, and it’s just like, man, I don’t get it.</p>

<h6 id="4414">44:14</h6>
<p>All of our back end and front end stuff is all mostly vanilla JavaScript and Angular and Node. But I’ve really been dying to switch over to TypeScript. Because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve sat there staring at my code for hours just trying to figure out, you know, how I got an undefined somewhere or why, you know, why my object isn’t an object.</p>

<h6 id="4439">44:39</h6>
<p>Yeah. It’s always parse int is the answer. But the other day we were trying to get… Yeah, Comma 10, because you’re going to mess it up if you don’t do Comma 10 weirdly. But we’re doing like some element query selector dot last child because we actually needed to grab a text node that was like the total so we could like send that total off to some A -B test thing.</p>

<h6 id="4511">45:11</h6>
<p>And… But the total was not wrapped in a node. So we had to just like somehow get this little bit of string without doing some crazy ugly regex and we are like element last child and then we’re like, okay, you know, send last child and it’s just like, nah, I don’t do that.</p>

<h6 id="4529">45:29</h6>
<p>And you’re just like, what’s going on? Because you like console log, you know, element last child and it’s like 45 .00 and you’re like, okay, cool, that’s a number. That’s right. And then… But the type, it’s actually a node item that you have.</p>

<h6 id="4543">45:43</h6>
<p>So you have to do like node item dot text content and like… And then you parse int on that and it’s… It was just like a… Or parse float, I think is what we did because it’s a decimal. But man, it was just such a…</p>

<h6 id="4556">45:56</h6>
<p>Such a WTF moment because you’re just like, I don’t get this. I do not understand… That’s classic JavaScript. Yeah, yeah. You’re staring at the code. It’s telling you the right answers when you try to check them and then it just isn’t.</p>

<h6 id="4612">46:12</h6>
<p>And so… But I think that’s the reality. reality we all live in is we’re all bug hunters for our own code. Wise words. I had, so, okay, this testing, and you guys were saying you build the interface for cross browser testing.</p>

<h6 id="4633">46:33</h6>
<p>So, like, does implementing a test suite, like, you know, maybe that dream suite is obviously like a nice thing, but does that slow down your development? Is my job a bummer in what do we say to the shop talk listener who’s under the gun from their boss to, like, ship a WordPress site every week or something like that?</p>

<h6 id="4659">46:59</h6>
<p>What about, we can also talk workflow, because it sounds like that’s related to that. Like, what is testing and workflow like? I think if you have a really nice setup, and a team that supports you and some good infrastructure, it can make your job so much easier because you’ll have a bunch of tests that run overnight, you come into work in the morning, and you have a checklist of stuff that is broken.</p>

<h6 id="4728">47:28</h6>
<p>Over night, how long do these things take? I mean, it depends on how big you are, how much you invest in this. A lot of our biggest customers do run tests overnight that take hours and test every page on their website, a full application test across tons of different browsers and devices.</p>

<h6 id="4750">47:50</h6>
<p>We actually have one guy who has a script that takes the videos of all of his automated tests that run overnight and stitches them together into one big long video with captions showing what’s happening at every moment.</p>

<h6 id="4806">48:06</h6>
<p>And the first thing he does when he comes in is make his coffee and watches those tests. What? And sees what breaks. My God. Yeah. Wow, I watch Overwatch, YouTube’s, but that’s cool too. Remember that guy in Waterworld, and his job was just to report how much oil there was in the oil tanker, and they’d like, I don’t know, that just seems like an awful job, but if he…</p>

<h6 id="4831">48:31</h6>
<p>Wow, okay. But you can go that deep is kind of what you’re saying. You can compile out some video if you want. Yeah, you just get to know where your stuff gets broken. So I guess like somebody who has to, the good fast cheap triangle, they’re building on the fast and cheap end.</p>

<h6 id="4856">48:56</h6>
<p>Like, does testing fit into their lifestyle, or do they need to wait on some, is it more for something like a product that’s kind of long -term, has a longevity? There’s a lot to be gained for both. I think the fast and cheap quadrant can get a lot out of it just by saying, writing a test that’s super simple, goes to a page, does a thing, checks for errors.</p>

<h6 id="4929">49:29</h6>
<p>Just kind of a sanity test on your site. You can run that when you make changes just to check that, okay, yeah, I didn’t massively screw this up. I can keep moving forward on this. That’s something you could probably do, like pre -commit or something, just something like run it through Chrome on my machine and just see if I messed it up?</p>

<h6 id="4959">49:59</h6>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Or say you have a lot of users still on IE 10 for whatever reason. You know, you abandoned your Windows 7 box years ago, so your IE10 is gone. And you just want to make sure it works really quick.</p>

<h6 id="5019">50:19</h6>
<p>You can just record a quick Selenium test, click around a bit. And then every time you make a change, before you push it up, you can just run it and make sure that it still works. You know, it’s probably 10 minutes to record the test.</p>

<h6 id="5032">50:32</h6>
<p>And then you can play it back however many times you want. And you’ll always be able to know before you commit your changes that, yeah, your site still works. At least the main thing that that page is doing still works.</p>

<h6 id="5048">50:48</h6>
<p>So it’s not a big investment for a really big payoff. Yeah, that changes aren’t like no breaking changes kind of. Yeah, just a fence for that. Yeah, and just over time, the longer you do that, the longer you stick in that fast and cheap quadrant, the more tests you’re going to end up with.</p>

<h6 id="5112">51:12</h6>
<p>And over time, that just builds and builds into… And before you know it, you have an automated test suite that, you know, is fairly comprehensive. Almost without thinking about it. And then once you have that suite of tests built up, you’re probably going to start seeing patterns and things that you can abstract out.</p>

<h6 id="5131">51:31</h6>
<p>And then you have more generic tests. And before you know it, you’re starting to have like a testing framework customized for your own site. So I mean, I think really what I see is the fast and cheap quadrant can turn into testing Nirvana pretty quickly.</p>

<h6 id="5147">51:47</h6>
<p>So while I’m striking out with metaphors, let’s say… Let’s go. Yeah, okay. You know how there’s like… I might do it. There’s pills for like high blood pressure, you know? But like another one of those solutions for that is to like not eat nachos for breakfast.</p>

<h6 id="5210">52:10</h6>
<p>about my breakfast nachos? The science is still out here. Sorry. Is there some situations like that too? You don’t need as much testing if you do these practices, kind of thing. Is that worth talking about?</p>

<h6 id="5225">52:25</h6>
<p>Like what can you do to help yourself here with making sure your kind of cross -browser cool and bug -free? I think CanIUse is an excellent resource to figure out what CSS works on what browsers. So you should have a good gut feeling for what is safe to use and what isn’t safe to use.</p>

<h6 id="5249">52:49</h6>
<p>Yeah, so with CanIUse, we talked about analytics previously. CanIUse has an analytics integration. And so if you go and it’s CanIUse and you type in grid or flex box or whatever kind of new fancy animation property you want to put in there.</p>

<h6 id="5307">53:07</h6>
<p>And then you can actually import your analytics. So not only will it tell you a global level across what property will be supported across all global browser usage, but specifically about what usage you have for your users.</p>

<h6 id="5321">53:21</h6>
<p>So say you’re testing grid or whatever, you can actually quickly go in there, say you’re gonna use grid for the majority of your layout. Oh wow, well I have 60% of my users don’t support grid. Next question is how do you handle that?</p>

<h6 id="5338">53:38</h6>
<p>But just knowing what you’re up against and being responsible about what properties you’re using and not getting just so blinded about the excitement about new things coming out, but just being aware of how responsible, having some of these cohesive experiences are because frankly, a bad experience that’s quickly untested and slips to the cracks can really make or break a company.</p>

<h6 id="5405">54:05</h6>
<p>If you think about someone that is heavily relying on, say a nonprofit that heavily relies on staying up in via donations or an e -commerce site that’s trying to create a brand or create sales, if you have for instance a JavaScript, that annoying little JavaScript error that slipped to the cracks, maybe that entire checkout funnel or donation funnel is broken, say you’re deploying code and you’re not testing that, that can really make or break the success of your company and your online experience.</p>

<h6 id="5433">54:33</h6>
<p>And so it’s not just one thing like can I use, it’s just really building that muscle of testing and that mindset and making it a good habit for your team to have a portion of QA and just going through and spot checking and running the tests of suites and eventually it will start building up and building up and becoming faster so it’s not such a monotonous task, just clicking around a website and then changing configs and then repeating those actions.</p>

<h6 id="5504">55:04</h6>
<p>That was a, was a nice wise words to probably wrap up that section with a little bit. So as we kind of approach the sad ending of this show a little bit, maybe, Dave, if you have any final questions, it’d be good to ask those and then.</p>

<h6 id="5522">55:22</h6>
<p>Yeah. Uh, I think, I think I just have one question and, um, I think it’s like very timely because it’s on the top of everyone’s mind, but, um, our, our web driver scripts, powering Russian botnets. I, I have seen things.</p>

<h6 id="5539">55:39</h6>
<p>Um, wow, I think like people trying to use a service, not necessarily yours, but to run malicious, uh, intense. Yep. Yep. I think Selenium, uh, definitely has potential for great evil. Um, seeing people, um, yeah, I’ve seen people use, uh, Selenium to, Scrape website.</p>

<h6 id="5605">56:05</h6>
<p>I don’t know if I should be talking about this, but I’ve seen I’ve seen people use it to Automate other people’s browsers and get them to mine bitcoins. I’ve seen people use Selenium I mean the answer is of course they are yeah the language for that, you know like it’s just that’s just the way it is Anything you would want to hijack someone’s browser to do Selenium This is the choice That’s I often thought I should like make a gold plug -in That would when you spin up gulp or grunt or something It would like mine bitcoins, you know and like I install it at my company It rolls out to like 400 developers and then Then all of a sudden people are mining bitcoins for me and they don’t know be cool If there is a low -level thing and your computer that you could make it use touch ID or face ID or whatever before Us Selenium process was allowed to start so even if you’re running them overnight at least you got a like face ID Before you leave for the night That’d be cool No, that’s fun.</p>

<h6 id="5710">57:10</h6>
<p>Anyway, sorry It is I think that was kind of like a I don’t know if I can now program a computer to drive the web What else can I program it to? To do yeah, and the answer is Anything I have a I have a fun little personal project where I actually use Selenium to go to Slack and I have it kind of read and interact with slack and get information and pipe it over I’m a terminal junkie.</p>

<h6 id="5741">57:41</h6>
<p>So I have it basically just pipe slack into my terminal Whoa, and I can have I can you know send my message and have it Send that to Selenium and then Selenium will type it into Slack and press enter I get all of the battery loss of running it in Chrome and all of the inconvenience of using it through my terminal.</p>

<h6 id="5800">58:00</h6>
<p>It’s great So I have a stand -up bot that talks to me every day. Could I program when that message comes in, could it just go to my GitHub, like go to the project that’s relevant to the bot asking a question, check insights, and then kind of like give a commit history on what I did?</p>

<h6 id="5821">58:21</h6>
<p>Yeah, it could. A lot of what I use Selenium for is like, cause I’m too lazy to actually figure out how to properly scrape a website or properly automate a website. I’ll just say, okay, load up a browser, pretend I’m actually there.</p>

<h6 id="5834">58:34</h6>
<p>Mm, wow. Interesting. That’s fun. Okay, now my brain’s turning. All right, well, thank you all so much for coming on the show. I really appreciate it. For people who aren’t following you and giving you money, how can they do that?</p>

<h6 id="5849">58:49</h6>
<p>We’ll start with Eli. Don’t need money? Find me on Twitter at Eli Brumley. Feel free to give us the pitch for Crosby. Everybody gets a pitch at the end of the show anyway. You might as well do it. We haven’t done it officially.</p>

<h6 id="5900">59:00</h6>
<p>The pitch for CBT. Yes, cross -browser testing. I think it’s one of the best testing tools out there. You can actually sign up right now for the seven -day free trial. And you can test pretty much every component of our app to get a good feel of how you can integrate this into your environment and your workflow.</p>

<h6 id="5920">59:20</h6>
<p>It’s quite the tool. And if you still have questions, we have a ton of really smart guys here that would love to talk. via Twitter. X browser testing is our Twitter handle. We actually have webinars that happen throughout the week.</p>

<h6 id="5933">59:33</h6>
<p>And you can sign up for those. And those are really great times for you to come in and interact and ask specific questions about, can I do this, or how do I integrate this into my testing suite? And we’ve got some guys here that just love talking about testing.</p>

<h6 id="5949">59:49</h6>
<p>And it’s a great time to have some good one -on -one time, as well as if you want to learn some more high -level stuff like Selenium. Tony gives fantastic Selenium webinars that can really get you up and running within a few minutes.</p>

<h6 id="010003">01:00:03</h6>
<p>A reasonable amount of time. Right. There’s also the CodePen integration, too. I didn’t mention that. But that’s pretty cool how you can test anything on CodePen over cross -browser testing the visual way, or probably the screenshot way, too, I would think.</p>

<h6 id="010020">01:00:20</h6>
<p>Yep. Maybe all the ways. All the ways. If you make sure your CodePens work, test them across different browsers, watch your CodePen fail in IE6 and AOL Explorer. Yeah. It’ll be a good time. IE6 on there.</p>

<h6 id="010033">01:00:33</h6>
<p>We still have Netscape. We have Mozilla, not Firefox. Mozilla browser. Yeah. If you just want to get a blast from the past, sign up for trial and watch everything crash in IE7. I love this. I love it.</p>

<h6 id="010052">01:00:52</h6>
<p>All right. Well, thank you all so much. And thank you, dear listener, for downloading this and your podcatcher of choice. Be sure to starheartfavoritup. That’s how people find out about the show. Follow us on Twitter at ShopTalkShow for tens of tweets a month.</p>
